because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems which lead to health issues of many inhabitants in heavy smog struck beijing and most parts of northern china impacting a total of million people after this pollution shock air pollution became an important economic and social concern

vehicles to be removed from to and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources joint research between american and chinese researchers in concluded that much of the city s pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces on average of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city shandong province and tianjin municipality have a significant influence on beijing s air quality partly due to the prevailing south southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest in preparation for the summer olympics and to fulfill

portion for steel and cement making power plants in the coal mining regions of shanxi inner mongolia and shaanxi where coal consumption has tripled since and shandong also contribute to air pollution in beijing shandong shanxi hebei and inner mongolia respectively rank from first to fourth among chinese provinces by coal consumption there were four major coal fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter the first one gaojing thermal power plant was shut down in another two were shut in march the last one huaneng thermal power plant would be shut in between and the city planned to reduce million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to million tons in the government sometimes uses cloud seeding measures to increase the

 lagos lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands which are contained in the present day local government areas lgas of lagos island eti osa amuwo odofin and apapa the islands are separated by creeks fringing the southwest mouth of lagos lagoon while protected from the atlantic ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as bar beach which stretch up to east and west of the mouth due to rapid urbanization the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day lagos mainland ajeromi ifelodun and surulere this led to the classification of lagos into two main areas the island which was the initial city of lagos before it expanded into the area known as the mainland this city area was governed directly by the federal government through the lagos city council until the creation of lagos state in which led to the splitting of lagos city into the present day seven local government areas lgas and an addition of other towns which now make up lgas from the then western region to form the state lagos the capital of nigeria since its amalgamation in went on to become the capital of lagos state after its creation however the state capital was later moved to ikeja in and the federal capital moved to abuja in even though lagos is still widely referred to as a city the present day lagos also known as metropolitan lagos and officially as lagos metropolitan area is an urban agglomeration or conurbation consisting of lgas lcdas including ikeja the state capital of lagos state this conurbation makes up of lagos state s total land area but houses about of the state s total population the exact population of metropolitan lagos is disputed in the federal census data the conurbation had a population of about million people however the figure was disputed by the lagos state government which later released its own population data putting the population of lagos metropolitan area at approximately million as at unofficial figures put the population of greater metropolitan lagos which includes lagos and its surrounding metro area extending as far as into ogun state at approximately million lagos was originally inhabited by the awori subgroup of the yoruba people in the 15th century under the leadership of the oloye olofin the awori moved to an island now called iddo and then to the larger lagos island in the 16th century the awori settlement was conquered by the benin empire and the island became a benin war camp called eko under oba orhogbua the oba of benin at the time eko is still the native name for lagos lagos which means lakes was a name given to the settlement by the portuguese the present day lagos state has a high percentage of awori clan who migrated to the area from isheri along the ogun river throughout history it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area following its early settlement by the awori nobility and its conquest by the bini warlords of benin the state first came to the attention of the portuguese in the 15th century portuguese explorer rui de sequeira visited the area in naming the area around the city lago de curamo another explanation is that lagos was named for lagos portugal a maritime town that at the time was the main centre of portuguese expeditions down the african coast in britain s early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade its west africa squadron or preventative squadron as it was also known continued to pursue portuguese american french and cuban slave ships and to impose anti slavery treaties with west african coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the west african coast from sierra leone all the way to the niger delta today s nigeria and as far south as congo in britain appointed john beecroft consul of the bights of benin and biafra a position he held along with his governorship of fernando po until his death in john duncan was appointed vice consul and was located at wydah at the time of beecroft s appointment the kingdom of lagos under oba kosoko was in the western part of the consulate of the bights of benin and biafra and was a key slave trading port in and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence britain intervened in lagos in what is now known as the bombardment of lagos or capture of lagos resulting in the installation of oba akitoye and the ouster of oba kosoko oba akitoye then signed the treaty between great britain and lagos abolishing slavery the signing of the treaty ushered in the consular period in lagos history wherein britain provided military protection to lagos following threats from kosoko and the french who were positioned at wydah a decision was made by lord palmerston british prime minister who noted in the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal protectorate of lagos william mccoskry the acting consul in lagos with commander bedingfield convened a meeting with oba dosunmu on july aboard hms prometheus where britain s intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by august dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on lagos by commander bedingfield dosunmu relented and signed the lagos treaty of cession on august the remainder of modern day nigeria was seized in and when the colony and protectorate of nigeria was established in lagos was declared its capital continuing as such after the country s independence from britain in along with migrants from all over nigeria and other west african nations were the returnee ex slaves known as creoles who came from freetown sierra leone brazil and the west indies to lagos the creoles contributed to lagos modernisation and their knowledge of portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on lagos island since the 19th century lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of africans and europeans railway links and telephone cables connecting lagos to london had been established by electric street lighting was introduced in the city in lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of nigeria s economic boom before the creation of lagos state on may lagos which was the country s capital had been administered directly by the federal government as a federal territory through the federal ministry of lagos affairs while the lagos city council lcc governed the city lagos along with the towns from the then western region ikeja agege mushin ikorodu epe and badagry were eventually captured to create lagos state lagos city was split into the present day seven local government areas lgas while the other towns now make up lgas in the state lagos played the dual role of being the state and federal capital until when the state capital was moved to ikeja lagos was adversely affected during nigeria s military rule also on december the seat of the federal government was also formally relocated to abuja however lagos still remains the financial centre of the country and also grew to become the most populous conurbation

local government areas most notably lagos island lga lagos mainland lga and eti osa lga the mainland beyond the municipality of lagos on the other hand comprised several separate towns and settlements such as mushin ikeja and agege in the wake of the 1970s nigerian oil boom lagos experienced a population explosion untamed economic growth and unmitigated rural migration this caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly thus forming the present day lagos metropolitan area also known as metropolitan lagos the history of lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the lgas that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them by the metro area around lagos had extended beyond lagos state s boundaries and attained a megacity status this much larger area is

government parallel census and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of lagos constitute of the lagos state population the population of metropolitan lagos is about million a rejoinder to lagos state government views concluded that lagos state concealed the fact that the population projection for lagos urban agglomeration by the un agencies had been revised downwards

 new delhi new delhi is an urban district of delhi which serves as the capital of india and seat of all three branches of the government of india the foundation stone of the city was laid by george v emperor of india during the delhi durbar of it was designed by british architects sir edwin lutyens and sir herbert baker the new capital was inaugurated on february by viceroy and governor general of india lord irwin although colloquially delhi and new delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the national capital territory of delhi nct these are two distinct entities with new delhi forming a small part of delhi the national capital region is a much larger entity comprising the entire nct along with adjoining districts in neighboring states calcutta now kolkata was the capital of india during the british raj until december calcutta had become the epicenter of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century which led to the partition of bengal by then viceroy of british india lord curzon this created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of british officials in calcutta the anti colonial sentiments amongst the public led to complete boycott of british goods which forced the colonial government to reunite bengal and immediately shift the capital to new delhi old delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient india and the delhi sultanate most notably of the mughal empire from to during the early 1900s a proposal was made to the british administration to shift the capital of the british indian empire as india was officially named from calcutta on the east coast to delhi the government of british india felt that it would be logistically easier to administer india from delhi which is in the centre of northern india the land for building the new city of delhi was acquired under the land acquisition act on december during the delhi durbar george v then emperor of india along with queen mary his consort made the announcement that the capital of the raj was to be shifted from calcutta to delhi while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy s residence in the coronation park kingsway camp the foundation stone of new delhi was laid by king george v and queen mary at the site of delhi durbar of at kingsway camp on december during their imperial visit large parts of new delhi were planned by edwin lutyens who first visited delhi in and herbert baker both leading 20th century british architects the contract was given to sobha singh the original plan called for its construction in tughlaqabad inside the tughlaqabad fort but this was given up because of the delhi calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort construction really began after world war i and was completed by the city that was later dubbed lutyens delhi was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on february by lord irwin the viceroy lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to britain s imperial aspirations soon lutyens started considering other places indeed the delhi town planning committee set up to plan the new imperial capital with george swinton as chairman and john a brodie and lutyens as members submitted reports for both north and south sites however it was rejected by the viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high the central axis of new delhi which today faces east at india gate was previously meant to be a north south axis linking the viceroy s house at one end with paharganj at the other eventually owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the north side the committee settled on the south site a site atop the raisina hill formerly raisina village a meo village was chosen for the rashtrapati bhawan then known as the viceroy s house the reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the dinapanah citadel which was also considered the site of indraprastha the ancient region of delhi subsequently the foundation stone was shifted from the site of delhi durbar of where the coronation pillar stood and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the secretariat the rajpath also known as king s way stretched from the india gate to the rashtrapati bhawan the secretariat building the two blocks of which flank the rashtrapati bhawan and houses ministries of the government of india and the parliament house both designed by baker are located at the sansad marg and run parallel to the rajpath in the south land up to safdarjung s tomb was acquired to create what is today known as lutyens bungalow zone before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of raisina hill a circular railway line around the council house now parliament house called the imperial delhi railway was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years the last stumbling block was the agra delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal all india war memorial india gate and kingsway rajpath which was a problem because the old delhi railway station served the entire city at that time the line was shifted to run along the yamuna river and it began operating in the new delhi railway station opened in with a single platform at ajmeri gate near paharganj and was completed in time for the city s inauguration in as construction of the viceroy s house the present rashtrapati bhavan central secretariat parliament house and all india war memorial india gate was winding down the building of a shopping district and a new plaza connaught place began in and was completed by named after prince arthur 1st duke of connaught it was designed by robert tor russell chief architect to the public works department pwd after the capital of india moved to delhi a temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months in in north delhi most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the old secretariat in old delhi the building now houses the delhi legislative assembly a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of india including the bengal presidency and madras presidency subsequently housing for them was developed around gole market area in the 1920s built in the 1940s to house government employees with bungalows for senior officials in the nearby lodhi estate area lodhi colony near historic lodhi gardens was the last residential areas built by the british raj after

territory and eventually the chief commissioner was replaced by a lieutenant governor the constitution sixty ninth amendment act declared the union territory of delhi to be formally known as national capital territory of delhi a system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers excluding law and order which remained with the central government the actual enforcement of the legislation came in the first major extension of new delhi outside of lutyens delhi came in the 1950s when the central public works department cpwd developed a large area of land southwest of lutyens delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of chanakyapuri where land was allotted for embassies chanceries high commissions and residences of ambassadors around a wide central vista shanti path

million residents istanbul is one of the world s most populous cities and ranks as the world s 4th largest city proper and the largest european city istanbul is viewed as a bridge between the east and west founded under the name of byzantion Œ≤œÖŒ∂Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒøŒΩ on the sarayburnu promontory around bce the city grew in size and influence having become one of the most important cities in history after its reestablishment as constantinople in ce it served as an imperial capital for almost centuries during the roman byzantine and the latin and the ottoman empires it was instrumental in the advancement of christianity during roman and byzantine times before the ottomans conquered the city in ce and transformed it into an islamic stronghold and the seat of the ottoman caliphate istanbul s strategic position on the historic silk road rail networks to europe and the middle east and the only sea route between the black sea and the mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace while ankara was chosen instead as the new turkish capital after the turkish war of independence the city has maintained its prominence in geopolitical and cultural affairs the population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s as migrants from across anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them arts music film and cultural festivals were established towards the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network in the city approximately foreign visitors arrived in istanbul in five years after it was named a european capital of culture making the city the world s fifth most popular tourist destination the city s biggest attraction is its historic center partially listed as a unesco world heritage site and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city s natural harbor the golden horn in the beyoƒülu district considered a global city istanbul has one of the fastest growing metropolitan economies in the world it hosts the headquarters of many turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country s gross domestic product hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion istanbul has bid for the summer olympics five times in twenty years the first known name of the city is byzantium byz√°ntion the name given to it at its foundation by megarean colonists around bce the name is thought to be derived from a personal name byzas ancient greek tradition refers to a legendary king of that name as the leader of the greek colonists modern scholars have also hypothesized that the name of byzas was of local thracian or illyrian origin and hence predated the megarean settlement after constantine the great made it the new eastern capital of the roman empire in ce the city became widely known as constantinople which as the latinized form of konstantino√∫polis means the city of constantine he also attempted to promote the name nova roma and its greek version nea romƒì new rome but this did not enter widespread usage constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the west until the establishment of the turkish republic and kostantiniyye and be makam e qonstantiniyyah al mahmiyyah meaning the protected location of constantinople and iÃástanbul were the names used alternatively by the ottomans during their rule the use of constantinople to refer to the city during the ottoman period from the mid 15th century is now considered politically incorrect even if not historically inaccurate by turks by the 19th century the city had acquired other names used by either foreigners or turks europeans used constantinople to refer to the whole of the city but used the name stamboul as the turks also did to describe the walled peninsula between the golden horn and the sea of marmara pera from the greek word for across was used to describe the area between the golden horn and the bosphorus but turks also used the name beyoƒülu today the official name for one of the city s constituent districts islambol meaning either city of islam or full of islam was sometimes colloquially used to refer to the city and was even engraved on some ottoman coins but the belief that it was the precursor to the present name iÃástanbul is belied by the fact that the latter existed well before the former and even predates the ottoman conquest of the city the name iÃástanbul colloquially is commonly held to derive from the medieval greek phrase pronounced which means to the city and is how constantinople was referred to by the local greeks this reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity the importance of constantinople in the ottoman world was also reflected by its ottoman name der saadet meaning the gate to prosperity in ottoman an alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name constantinople with the first and third syllables dropped a turkish folk etymology traces the name to islam bol plenty of islam because the city was called islambol plenty of islam or islambul find islam as the capital of the islamic ottoman empire it is first attested shortly after the conquest and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to sultan mehmed ii himself some ottoman sources of the 17th century such as evliya √ßelebi describe it as the common turkish name of the time between the late 17th and late 18th centuries it was also in official use the first use of the word islambol on coinage was in ah during the reign of sultan ahmed iii nevertheless the use of the name constantinople remained common in english into the 20th century istanbul became common after turkey adopted the latin alphabet in and urged other countries to use the city s turkish name in modern turkish the name is written as iÃástanbul with a dotted iÃá as the turkish alphabet distinguishes between a dotted and dotless i in english the stress is on the first or last syllable but in turkish it is on the second syllable tan a person from the city is an iÃástanbullu plural iÃástanbullular although istanbulite is used in english neolithic artifacts uncovered by archeologists at the beginning of the 21st century indicate that istanbul s historic peninsula was settled as far back as the 6th millennium bce that early settlement important in the spread of the neolithic revolution from the near east to europe lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by rising water levels the first human settlement on the asian side the fikirtepe mound is from the copper age period with artifacts dating from to bce on the european side near the point of the peninsula sarayburnu there was a thracian settlement during the early 1st millennium bce modern authors have linked it to the thracian toponym lygos mentioned by pliny the elder as an earlier name for the site of byzantium the history of the city proper begins around bce when greek settlers from megara established byzantium on the european side of the bosphorus the settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the golden horn on the site of the early thracian settlements fueling the nascent city s economy the city experienced a brief period of persian rule at the turn of the 5th century bce but the greeks recaptured it during the greco persian wars byzantium then continued as part of the athenian league and its successor the second athenian league before gaining independence in bce long allied with the romans byzantium officially became a part of the roman empire in ce byzantium s decision to side with the roman usurper pescennius niger against emperor septimius severus cost it dearly by the time it surrendered at the end of ce two years of siege had left the city devastated five years later severus began to rebuild byzantium and the city regained and by some accounts surpassed its previous prosperity constantine the great effectively became the emperor of the whole of the roman empire in september two months later he laid out the plans for a new christian city to replace byzantium as the eastern capital of the empire the city was named nova roma most called it constantinople a name that persisted into the 20th century on may constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the roman empire which was later permanently divided between the two sons of theodosius i upon his death on january when the city became the capital of the eastern roman byzantine empire the establishment of constantinople served as one of constantine s most lasting accomplishments shifting roman power eastward as the city became a center of greek culture and christianity numerous churches were built across the city including the hagia sophia which was built during the reign of justinian the great and remained the world s largest cathedral for a thousand years constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the hippodrome of constantinople accommodating tens of thousands of spectators the hippodrome became central to civic life and in the 5th and 6th centuries the epicenter of episodes of unrest including the nika riots constantinople s location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time for many centuries its walls and seafront protected europe against invaders from the east and the advance of islam during most of the middle ages the latter part of the byzantine era constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the european continent and at times the largest in the world constantinople began to decline continuously after the end of the reign of basil ii in the final blow was given by the conquest of villardouin and enrico dandolo in during the fourth crusade where the city was sacked and pillaged the city subsequently became the center of the latin empire created by catholic crusaders to replace the orthodox byzantine empire hagia sophia was converted to a catholic church in the byzantine empire was restored albeit weakened in constantinople s churches defenses and basic services were in disrepair and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century after the reconquest of however some of the city s monuments were restored and some like the two deisis mosaics in hagia sofia and kariye were created various economic and military policies instituted by andronikos ii such as the reduction of military forces weakened the empire and left it vulnerable to attack in the mid 14th century the ottoman turks began a strategy of gradually taking smaller towns and cities cutting off constantinople s supply routes and strangling it slowly on may after an eight week siege during which the last roman emperor constantine xi was killed sultan mehmed ii the conqueror captured constantinople and declared it the new capital of the ottoman empire hours later the sultan rode to the hagia sophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the islamic creed converting the grand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the city s refusal to surrender peacefully mehmed declared himself as the new kaysar i r√ªm the ottoman turkish equivalent of caesar of rome and the ottoman state was reorganized into an empire following the conquest of constantinople mehmed ii immediately set out to revitalize the city by then also known as istanbul he urged the return of those who had fled the city during the siege and resettled muslims jews and christians from other parts of anatolia he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to constantinople by september from all over the islamic empire prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city these people were called s√ºrg√ºn in turkish however many people escaped again from the city and there were several outbreaks of plague so that in mehmet allowed the deported greeks to come back to the city he also invited people from all over europe to his capital creating a cosmopolitan society that persisted through much of the ottoman period plague continued however to be essentially endemic in istanbul for the rest of the century as it had been from with a few years of respite between and and and from to epidemics originating in the west and in the hejaz and southern russia population growth in anatolia however allowed istanbul to replace its losses and maintain its population of around inhabitants down to mehmed ii also repaired the city s damaged infrastructure including the whole water system began to build the grand bazaar and constructed topkapƒ± palace the sultan s official residence with the transfer of the capital from edirne formerly adrianople to constantinople the new state was declared as the successor and continuation of the roman empire the ottomans quickly transformed the city from a bastion of christianity to a symbol of islamic culture religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques often adjoined by schools hospitals and public baths the ottoman dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in with istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries suleiman the magnificent s reign from to was a period of especially great artistic and architectural achievement chief architect mimar sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city while ottoman arts of ceramics stained glass calligraphy and miniature flourished the population of istanbul was by the end of the 18th century a period of rebellion at the start of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive sultan mahmud ii and eventually to the tanzimat period which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city bridges across the golden horn were constructed during this period and istanbul was connected to the rest of the european railway network in the 1880s modern facilities such as a water supply network electricity telephones and trams were gradually introduced to istanbul over the following decades although later than to other european cities the modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the ottoman empire sultan abdul hamid ii was deposed with the young turk revolution in and the ottoman parliament closed since february was reopened years later on july which marked the beginning of the second constitutional era a series of wars in the early 20th century such as the italo turkish war and the balkan wars plagued the ailing empire s capital and resulted in the ottoman coup d √©tat which brought the regime of the three pashas the ottoman empire joined world war i on the side of the central powers and was ultimately defeated the deportation of armenian intellectuals on april was among the major events which marked the start of the armenian genocide during wwi as a result of the war and the events in its aftermath the city s christian population declined from to between and the armistice of mudros was signed on october and the allies occupied constantinople on november the ottoman parliament was dissolved by the allies on april and the ottoman delegation led

its anniversary on october the grand national assembly of turkey declared the establishment of the turkish republic with ankara as its capital mustafa kemal atat√ºrk became the republic s first president ankara was selected as turkey s capital in to distance the new secular republic from its ottoman history from the late 1940s and early 1950s istanbul underwent great structural change as new public squares boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city sometimes at the expense of historical buildings the population of istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s as people from anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis this sudden sharp rise in the city s population caused a large demand for housing and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of istanbul istanbul is located in north western turkey within the marmara region on a total area of the bosphorus which connects the sea of marmara to the black sea divides the city into a european thracian side comprising the historic and economic centers and an asian anatolian side the city is further divided by the golden horn a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former byzantium and constantinople were founded the confluence of the sea of marmara the bosphorus and the golden horn at the heart of present day istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years and remains a prominent feature of the city s landscape following the model of rome the historic peninsula is said to be characterized by seven hills each topped by imperial mosques the easternmost of these hills is the site of topkapƒ± palace on the sarayburnu rising from the opposite side of the golden horn is another conical hill where the modern beyoƒülu district is situated because of the topography buildings in beyoƒülu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls and roads were laid out in the form of steps √ºsk√ºdar on the asian side exhibits similarly hilly characteristics with the terrain gradually extending down to the bosphorus coast but the landscape in ≈üemsipa≈üa and ayazma is more abrupt akin to a promontory the highest point in istanbul is √ßamlƒ±ca hill with an altitude of the northern half of istanbul has a higher mean elevation compared to the south coast with locations surpassing and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling fjords especially around the northern end of the bosphorus where it opens up to the black sea istanbul is situated near the north anatolian fault close to the boundary between the african and eurasian plates this fault zone which runs from northern anatolia to the sea of marmara has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes throughout the city s history among the most devastating of these seismic events was the earthquake which caused a tsunami that broke over the walls of the city and killed more than people more recently in an earthquake with its epicenter in nearby iÃázmit left people dead including people in istanbul s suburbs the people of istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the city s near future as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate istanbul s rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly seismologists say the risk of a magnitude or greater earthquake striking istanbul by is more than in the k√∂ppen geiger classification system istanbul has a borderline mediterranean climate csa humid subtropical climate cfa and oceanic climate cfb due to its location in a transitional climatic zone since precipitation in summer months ranges from depending on location the city cannot be classified as solely mediterranean or humid subtropical due to its size diverse topography maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water to the north and south istanbul exhibits microclimates the northern half of the city as well as the bosporus coastline express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates because of humidity from the black sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation the climate in the populated areas of the city to the south located on the sea of marmara is warmer drier and less affected by humidity the annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much bah√ßek√∂y mm than it is in the southern marmara coast florya mm there is a significant difference between annual mean temperatures on the north and south coasts as well bah√ßek√∂y kartal parts of the province that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental influences with much more pronounced night day and summer winter temperature differences in winter some parts of the province average freezing or below at night istanbul s persistently high humidity reaches most mornings because of this fog is very common although more so in northern parts of the city and away from the city center dense fog disrupts transportation in the region including on the bosphorus and is common during the autumn and winter months when the humidity remains high into the afternoon the humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate by midday during the summer months but the lingering humidity exacerbates the moderately high summer temperatures during these summer months high temperatures average around and rainfall is uncommon there are only about fifteen days with measurable precipitation between june and august the summer months also have the highest concentration of thunderstorms winter is colder in istanbul than in most other cities around the mediterranean basin with low temperatures averaging lake effect snow from the black sea is common although difficult to forecast with the potential to be heavy and as with the fog disruptive to the city s infrastructure spring and autumn are mild but often wet and unpredictable chilly winds from the northwest and warm gusts from the south sometimes in the same day tend to cause fluctuations in temperature overall istanbul has an annual average of with significant precipitation which amounts to per year the highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city center on the marmara coast are and the greatest rainfall recorded in a day is and the highest recorded snow cover is global warming in turkey may cause more urban heatwaves droughts storms and flooding sea level rise is forecast to affect city infrastructure for example kadƒ±koy metro station is threatened with flooding xeriscaping of green spaces has been suggested however istanbul does not have a climate change action plan merely an inactive website the fatih district which was named after sultan mehmed the conqueror turkish fatih sultan mehmed corresponds to what was until the ottoman conquest in the whole of the city of constantinople today is the capital district and called the historic peninsula of istanbul on the southern shore of the golden horn across the medieval genoese citadel of galata on the northern shore the genoese fortifications in galata were largely demolished in the 19th century leaving only the galata tower to make way for the northward expansion of the city galata karak√∂y is today a quarter within the beyoƒülu pera district which forms istanbul s commercial and entertainment center and includes iÃástiklal avenue and taksim square dolmabah√ße palace the seat of government during the late ottoman period is located in the be≈üikta≈ü district on the european shore of the bosphorus strait to the north of beyoƒülu the sublime porte b√¢b ƒ± √¢li which became a metonym for the ottoman government was originally used to describe the imperial gate b√¢b ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn at the outermost courtyard of the topkapƒ± palace but after the 18th century the sublime porte or simply porte began to refer to the gate of the sadrazamlƒ±k prime ministry compound in the caƒüaloƒülu quarter near topkapƒ± palace where the offices of the sadrazam grand vizier and other viziers were located and where foreign diplomats were received the former village of ortak√∂y is situated within be≈üikta≈ü and gives its name to the ortak√∂y mosque on the bosphorus near the bosphorus bridge lining both the european and asian shores of the bosphorus are the historic yalƒ±s luxurious chalet mansions built by ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes farther inland outside the city s inner ring road are levent and maslak istanbul s main business districts during the ottoman period √ºsk√ºdar and kadƒ±k√∂y were outside the scope of urban istanbul serving as tranquil outposts with seaside yalƒ±s and gardens but in the second half of the 20th century the asian side experienced major urban growth the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city much of the asian side of the bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in european istanbul accounting for a third of the city s population but only a quarter of its employment as a result of istanbul s exponential growth in the 20th century a significant portion of the city is composed of gecekondus literally built overnight referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings at present some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass housing compounds moreover large scale gentrification and urban renewal projects have been taking place such as the one in tarlaba≈üƒ± some of these projects like the one in sulukule have faced criticism the turkish government also has ambitious plans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the european side in conjunction with plans for a third airport the new parts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban functions housing million people istanbul does not have a primary urban park but it has several green areas g√ºlhane park and yƒ±ldƒ±z park were originally included within the grounds of two of istanbul s palaces topkapƒ± palace and yƒ±ldƒ±z palace but they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the turkish republic another park fethi pa≈üa korusu is situated on a hillside adjacent to the bosphorus bridge in anatolia opposite yƒ±ldƒ±z palace in europe along the european side and close to the fatih sultan mehmet bridge is emirgan park which was known as the kyparades cypress forest during the byzantine period in the ottoman period it was first granted to ni≈üancƒ± feridun ahmed pasha in the 16th century before being granted by sultan murad iv to the safavid emir g√ªne han in the 17th century hence the name emirgan the park was later owned by khedive ismail pasha of ottoman egypt and sudan in the 19th century emirgan park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual tulip festival is held there since the akp government s decision to replace taksim gezi park with a replica of the ottoman era taksim military barracks which was transformed into the taksim stadium in before being demolished in for building gezi park sparked a series of nationwide protests in covering a wide range of issues popular during the summer among istanbulites is belgrad forest spreading across at the northern edge of the city the forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during byzantine and ottoman times survive istanbul is primarily known for its byzantine and ottoman architecture but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city examples of genoese and roman architecture remain visible in istanbul alongside their ottoman counterparts nothing of the architecture of the classical greek period has survived but roman architecture has proved to be more durable the obelisk erected by theodosius in the hippodrome of constantinople is still visible in sultanahmet square and a section of the valens aqueduct constructed in the late 4th century stands relatively intact at the western edge of the fatih district the column of constantine erected in ce to mark the new roman capital stands not far from the hippodrome early byzantine architecture followed the classical roman model of domes and arches but improved upon these elements as in the church of the saints sergius and bacchus the oldest surviving byzantine church in istanbul albeit in ruins is the monastery of stoudios later converted into the imrahor mosque which was built in after the recapture of constantinople in the byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches extant chora church and pammakaristos church the pinnacle of byzantine architecture and one of istanbul s most iconic structures is the hagia sophia topped by a dome in diameter the hagia sophia stood as the world s largest cathedral for centuries and was later converted into a mosque and as it stands now a museum among the oldest surviving examples of ottoman architecture in istanbul are the anadoluhisarƒ± and rumelihisarƒ± fortresses which assisted the ottomans during their siege of the city over the next four centuries the ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of istanbul building towering mosques and ornate palaces the largest palace topkapƒ± includes a diverse array of architectural styles from baroque inside the harem to its neoclassical style ender√ªn library the imperial mosques include fatih mosque bayezid mosque yavuz selim mosque s√ºleymaniye mosque sultan ahmed mosque the blue mosque and yeni mosque all of which were built at the peak of the ottoman empire in the 16th and 17th centuries in the following centuries and especially after the tanzimat reforms ottoman architecture was supplanted by european styles an example of which is the imperial nuruosmaniye mosque areas around iÃástiklal avenue were filled with grand european embassies and rows of buildings in neoclassical renaissance revival and art nouveau styles which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in beyoƒülu including churches stores and theaters and official buildings such as dolmabah√ße palace since the municipal boundaries of istanbul have been coincident with the boundaries of its province the city considered capital of istanbul province is administered by the istanbul metropolitan municipality mmi which oversees the districts of the city province the current city structure can be traced back to the tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century before which islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the grand vizier following the model of french cities this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups millet across istanbul beyoƒülu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood laws enacted after the ottoman constitution of aimed to expand this structure across the city imitating the twenty arrondissements of paris but they were not fully implemented until when istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts this system continued beyond the founding of the turkish republic with the province renamed a belediye municipality but the municipality was disbanded in small settlements adjacent to major population centers in turkey including istanbul were merged into their respective primary cities during the early 1980s resulting in metropolitan municipalities the main decision making body of the istanbul metropolitan municipality is the municipal council with members drawn from district councils the municipal council is responsible for citywide issues including managing the budget maintaining civic infrastructure and overseeing museums and major cultural centers since the government operates under a powerful mayor weak council approach the council s leader the metropolitan mayor has the authority to make swift decisions often at the expense of transparency the municipal council is advised by the metropolitan executive committee although the committee also has limited power to make decisions of its own all representatives on the committee are appointed by the metropolitan mayor and the council with the mayor or someone of his or her choosing serving as head district councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts they each maintain their own budgets although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to review district decisions one fifth of all district council members including the district mayors also represent their districts in the municipal council all members of the district councils and the municipal council including the metropolitan mayor are elected to five year terms representing the justice and development party mevl√ºt uysal has been the mayor of istanbul since september with the istanbul metropolitan municipality and istanbul province having equivalent jurisdictions few responsibilities remain for the provincial government similar to the mmi the istanbul special provincial administration has a governor a democratically elected decision making body the provincial parliament and an appointed executive committee mirroring the executive committee at the municipal level the provincial executive committee includes a secretary general and leaders of departments that advise the provincial parliament the provincial administration s duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools residences government buildings and roads and the promotion of arts culture and nature conservation vasip ≈üahin has been the governor of istanbul province since september throughout most of its history istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world by ce constantinople had somewhere between and people edging out its predecessor rome for world s largest city constantinople jostled with other major historical cities such as baghdad chang an kaifeng and merv for the position of world s most populous city until the 12th century it never returned to being the world s largest but remained europe s largest city from to when it was surpassed by london the turkish statistical institute estimates that the population of istanbul metropolitan municipality was at the end of hosting of the country s population then about of the inhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits up from in and in of the residents live on the european side and on the asian side while the city ranks as the world s 5th largest city proper it drops to the 24th place as an urban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are roughly equivalent to the agglomeration today it forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in europe alongside moscow the city s annual population growth of ranks as the highest among the seventy eight largest metropolises in the organisation for economic co operation and development the high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country as the second and third fastest growing oecd metropolises are the turkish cities of iÃázmir and ankara istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century with its population increasing tenfold between and this growth in population comes in part from an expansion of city limits particularly between and when the number of istanbulites nearly doubled the remarkable growth was and still is largely fueled by migrants from eastern turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions the number of residents of istanbul originating from seven northern and eastern provinces is greater than the populations of their entire respective provinces sivas and kastamonu each account for more than half a million residents of istanbul istanbul s foreign population by comparison is very small residents in only of the city s residents are originally from istanbul the most densely populated areas tend to lie to the northwest west and southwest of the city center on the european side the most densely populated district on the asian side is √ºsk√ºdar istanbul has been a cosmopolitan city throughout much of its history but it has become more homogenized since the end of the ottoman empire the vast majority of people across turkey and in istanbul are muslim and more specifically members of the sunni branch of islam most sunnis follow the hanafi school of islamic thought although approximately of sunnis follow the shafi i school the largest non sunni muslim sect accounting for turks is the alevis a third of all alevis in the country live in istanbul mystic movements like sufism were officially banned after the establishment of the turkish republic but they still boast numerous followers the patriarch of constantinople has been designated ecumenical patriarch since the sixth century and has subsequently come to be widely regarded as the leader of the world s orthodox christians since the patriarchate has been based in istanbul s church of st george into the 19th century the christians of istanbul tended to be either greek orthodox or members of the armenian apostolic church the headquarters of the turkish orthodox church are located in the city because of events during the 20th century including the population exchange between greece and turkey a wealth tax and the istanbul riots the greek population originally centered in fener and samatya has decreased substantially at the start of the 21st century istanbul s greek population numbered down from in and according to the ottoman census of of total there are today between and armenians in istanbul down from about in partly due to the armenian genocide according to the ottoman census the largest ethnic minority in istanbul is the kurdish community originating from eastern and southeastern turkey although the kurdish presence in the city dates back to the early ottoman period the influx of kurds into the city has accelerated since the beginning of the kurdish turkish conflict with the pkk i e since the late 1970s about two to three million residents of istanbul are kurdish meaning there are more kurds in istanbul than in any other city in the world there are other significant ethnic minorities as well the bosniaks are the main people of an entire district bayrampa≈üa the neighborhood of balat used to be home to a sizable sephardi jewish community first formed after their expulsion from spain in romaniotes and ashkenazi jews resided in istanbul even before the sephardim but their proportion has since dwindled today of istanbul s jews are ashkenazi in large part due to emigration to israel the jewish population nationwide dropped from in to in with the majority of them living in either istanbul or iÃázmir levantines latin christians who settled in galata during the ottoman period played a seminal role in shaping the culture and architecture of istanbul during the 19th and early 20th centuries their population has dwindled but they remain in the city in small numbers from the increase in mutual cooperation between turkey and several african states like somalia and djibouti several young students and workers have been migrating to istanbul in search of better education and employment opportunities there is also a small nigerian congolese and cameroonian and north african community present istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since since the right wing justice and development party akp has won pluralities in every general and local election the city s electorate has also voted for the akp government s constitutional reforms proposed during the and constitutional referenda turkish president and former akp prime minister recep tayyip erdoƒüan was elected mayor of iÃástanbul in the local elections as the islamist welfare party candidate with of the vote winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as baƒücƒ±lar fatih sultanbeyli and esenler the opposition kemalist center left republican people s party chp currently the second major political force in both iÃástanbul and the country gets most of its support from more rural districts such as silivri √ßatalca and sarƒ±yer urban districts such as be≈üikta≈ü bakƒ±rk√∂y ≈üi≈üli and kadƒ±k√∂y have returned strong support for the chp in past elections the chp are generally strongest in the west where newer residential developments are taking place iÃástanbul has districts more than any other province in turkey since iÃástanbul is turkey s largest city and has usually voted in the same way as the country as a whole it is largely perceived in turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by iÃástanbul s electorate political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the iÃástanbul metropolitan municipality due to its electoral importance iÃástanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections including the local elections the incumbent mayor of the city is mevl√ºt uysal of the akp who was elected after the resignation of the previous mayor kadir topba≈ü the leader of the chp and parliamentary opposition kemal kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu ran against topba≈ü in the local elections he is currently a member of parliament for iÃástanbul between and prime minister recep tayyip erdoƒüan was also an mp for iÃástanbul for general elections the city is divided into electoral districts and returns mps to the turkish parliament in the presidential election of the city s electorate voted for akp candidate recep tayyip erdoƒüan although erdoƒüan won the most votes in iÃástanbul his failure to win above was seen as significant opposition candidate ekmeleddin iÃáhsanoƒülu came second with and the hdp pro kurdish and left wing candidate selahattin demirta≈ü won a substantial in and large scale anti akp government protests began in iÃástanbul and spread throughout the nation with a ppp adjusted gross domestic product of istanbul ranked 29th among the world s urban areas in since the mid 1990s istanbul s economy has been one of the fastest growing among oecd metro regions istanbul is responsible for of turkey s gdp with of the country s industrial labor force residing in the city its gdp per capita and productivity are greater than their national averages by and respectively owing in part to the focus on high value added activities with its high population and significant contribution to the turkish economy istanbul is responsible for two fifths of the nation s tax revenue that includes the taxes of us dollar billionaires based in istanbul the fifth highest number among cities around the world as expected for a city of its size istanbul has a diverse industrial economy producing commodities as varied as olive oil tobacco vehicles and electronics despite having a focus on high value added work its low value added manufacturing sector is substantial representing just of istanbul s gdp but four fifths of the city s total exports in companies based in istanbul produced exports worth and received imports totaling these figures were equivalent to and respectively of the national totals istanbul is home to borsa istanbul the sole exchange entity of turkey which combined the former istanbul stock exchange the istanbul gold exchange and the derivatives exchange of turkey the former istanbul stock exchange was originally established as the ottoman stock exchange in during the 19th and early 20th centuries bankalar caddesi banks street in galata was the financial center of the ottoman empire where the ottoman stock exchange was located bankalar caddesi continued to be istanbul s main financial district until the 1990s when most turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of levent and maslak in the istanbul stock exchange now borsa istanbul moved to its current building in the iÃástinye quarter of the sarƒ±yer district a new central business district is also under construction in ata≈üehir and will host the headquarters of various turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion as the only sea route between the oil rich black sea and the mediterranean the bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in the world more than tonnes of oil pass through the strait each year and the traffic on the bosphorus is three times that on the suez canal as a result there have been proposals to build a canal known as canal istanbul parallel to the strait on the european side of the city istanbul has three major shipping ports the port of haydarpa≈üa the port of ambarlƒ± and the port of zeytinburnu as well as several smaller ports and oil terminals along the bosphorus and the sea of marmara haydarpa≈üa situated at the southeastern end of the bosphorus was istanbul s largest port until the early 2000s shifts in operations to ambarlƒ± since then have left haydarpa≈üa running under capacity and with plans to decommission the port in ambarlƒ± on the western edge of the urban center had an annual capacity of teus compared to teus at haydarpa≈üa making it the fourth largest cargo terminal in the mediterranean basin the port of zeytinburnu is advantaged by its proximity to motorways and atat√ºrk international airport and long term plans for the city call for greater connectivity between all terminals and the road and rail networks istanbul is an increasingly popular tourist destination whereas just foreigners visited the city in it welcomed foreign tourists in making it the world s fifth most visited city istanbul is turkey s second largest international gateway after antalya receiving a quarter of the nation s foreign tourists istanbul s tourist industry is concentrated in the european side with of the city s hotels located there low and mid range hotels tend to be located on the sarayburnu higher end hotels are primarily located in the entertainment and financial centers north of the golden horn istanbul s seventy museums the most visited of which are the topkapƒ± palace museum and the hagia sophia bring in in revenue each year the city s environmental master plan also notes that there are and of historical significance in istanbul istanbul was historically known as a cultural hub but its cultural scene stagnated after the turkish republic shifted its focus toward ankara the new national government established programs that served to orient turks toward musical traditions especially those originating in europe but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital much of turkey s cultural scene had its roots in istanbul and by the 1980s and 1990s istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory by the end of the 19th century istanbul had established itself as a regional artistic center with turkish european and middle eastern artists flocking to the city despite efforts to make ankara turkey s cultural heart istanbul had the country s primary institution of art until the 1970s when additional universities and art journals were founded in istanbul during the 1980s artists formerly based in ankara moved in beyoƒülu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city with young artists and older turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there modern art museums including iÃástanbul modern the pera museum sakƒ±p sabancƒ± museum and santralistanbul opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city these museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula including the istanbul archaeology museums which ushered in the era of modern museums in turkey and the turkish and islamic arts museum the first film screening in turkey was at yƒ±ldƒ±z palace in a year after the technology publicly debuted in paris movie theaters rapidly cropped up in beyoƒülu with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as iÃástiklal avenue istanbul also became the heart of turkey s nascent film industry although turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s since then istanbul has been the most popular location to film turkish dramas and comedies the turkish film industry ramped up in the second half of the century and with uzak and my father and my son both filmed in istanbul the nation s movies began to see substantial international success istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films including from russia with love topkapi the world is not enough and mission istaanbul coinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the istanbul festival which began showcasing a variety of art from turkey and around the world in from this flagship festival came the international istanbul film festival and the istanbul international jazz festival in the early 1980s with its focus now solely on music and dance the istanbul festival has been known as the istanbul international music festival since the most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original istanbul festival is the istanbul biennial held every two years since its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing turkish visual art and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite biennales alongside the venice biennale and the s√£o paulo art biennial istanbul has numerous shopping centers from the historic to the modern the grand

preeminent status within the nation the third rome the whitestone one the first throne the forty forties the forty soroks sorok translates as forty but here it is old name of district or parish and forty in old russian means not but great many moscow is one of the twelve hero cities in old russian the word forty also meant a church administrative district which consisted of about forty churches the demonym for a moscow resident is moskvich for male or –∫–∞ moskvichka for female rendered in english as muscovite the name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the moskva river finno ugric merya and muroma people who were among the tribes which originally inhabited the area called the river mustajoki it has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term however there have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river the most linguistically well grounded and widely accepted is from the proto balto slavic root m≈≠zg muzg from the proto indo european wet so the name moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh its cognates include pool puddle and to wash to drown to dip immerse there exist as well similar place names in poland like mozgawa the original old russian form of the name is reconstructed as hence it was one of a few slavic ≈´ stem nouns as with other nouns of that declension it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were accusative case locative case genitive case from the latter forms came the modern russian name which is a result of morphological generalisation with the numerous slavic ƒÅ stem nouns however the form moskovƒ≠ has left some traces in many other languages such as ottoman turkish etc in a similar manner the latin name has been formed later it became a colloquial name for russia used in western europe in the 16th 17th centuries from it as well came english muscovy and muscovite various other theories of celtic iranian caucasic origins having little or no scientific ground are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists the oldest evidence of humans on the territory of moscow dates from the neolithic schukinskaya site on the moscow river within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered the burial ground of the fatyanovskaya culture the site of the iron age settlement of the dyakovo culture on the territory of the kremlin sparrow hills setun river and kuntsevskiy forest park etc in the 9th century the oka river was part of the volga trade route and the upper volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous finno ugric such as the merya and the expanding volga bulgars particularly the second son of khan kubrat who expanded the borders of the old great bulgaria scandinavian varangians and slavic peoples the earliest east slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the vyatichi and krivichi the moskva river was incorporated as part of kievan rus into the suzdal in the 11th century by ad a minor settlement had appeared on

a secular state which in practice meant that religion was repressed and society was to become atheistic during the period of 1930s a great number of churches in moscow were demolished including historical chudov monastery in the kremlin dating from the 14th century kazansky cathedral on the red square the cathedral of christ the savior constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over napoleon s army in and many more this continued even after the second world war in 1970s when persecutions against religion in the soviet union became less severe most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs offices factories or even warehouses since the disintegration of the soviet union in many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity among the churches reconstructed in the 1990s is an impressive new cathedral of christ the savior that once more has become a landmark it was built on the site of the old demolished cathedral where there had been a huge open swimming pool until the moscow mufti council claimed that muslims numbered around million of millions of the city s population in there are four mosques in the city moscow cathedral mosque has been built at the site of the former one it was officially inaugurated on september the new mosque has the capacity of ten thousand worshippers president of russia vladimir putin president of turkey recep tayyip erdoƒüan president of the state of palestine mahmoud abbas and local muslim leaders participated in the inauguration ceremony of this mosque moscow s architecture is world renowned moscow is the site of saint basil s cathedral with its elegant onion domes as well as the cathedral of christ the savior and the seven sisters the first kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century medieval moscow s design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares this layout as well as moscow s rivers helped shape moscow s design in subsequent centuries the kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century its towers and some of its churches were built by italian architects lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance from the end of the 15th century the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries palaces walls towers and churches the city s appearance had not changed much by the 18th century houses were made of pine and spruce logs with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark the rebuilding of moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires but also the needs of the nobility much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style for much of its architectural history moscow was dominated by orthodox churches however the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during soviet times especially as a result of joseph stalin s large scale effort to modernize moscow stalin s plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide which while greatly simplifying movement through the city were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts among the many casualties of stalin s demolitions was the sukharev tower a longtime city landmark as well as mansions and commercial buildings the city s newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition many of the city s churches which in most cases were some of moscow s oldest and most prominent buildings were destroyed some notable examples include the kazan cathedral and the cathedral of christ the savior during the 1990s both were rebuilt many smaller churches however were lost while the later stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation the earlier post revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with vkhutemas responsible for such landmarks as lenin s mausoleum another prominent architect was vladimir shukhov famous for shukhov tower just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by shukhov it was built between and as a transmission tower for a russian broadcasting company shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the constructivist architecture of early soviet russia he designed spacious elongated shop galleries most notably the gum department store on red square bridged with innovative metal and glass vaults perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the stalinist period are the so called seven sisters comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the kremlin a defining feature of moscow s skyline their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the manhattan municipal building in new york city and their style with intricate exteriors and a large central spire has been described as stalinist gothic architecture all seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the ostankino tower which when it was completed in was the highest free standing land structure in the world and today remains the world s seventy second tallest ranking among buildings such as the burj khalifa in dubai taipei in taiwan and the cn tower in toronto the soviet goal of providing housing for every family and the rapid growth of moscow s population led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks most of these date from the post stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power brezhnev khrushchev etc they are usually badly maintained although the city still has some five story apartment buildings constructed before the mid 1960s more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall and have elevators it is estimated that moscow has over twice as many elevators as new york city and four times as many as chicago moslift one of the city s major elevator operating companies has about elevator mechanics on call to release residents trapped in elevators stalinist era buildings mostly found in the central part of the city are massive and usually ornamented with socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes however small churches almost always eastern orthodox found across the city provide glimpses of its past the old arbat street a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city behind the stalinist fa√ßades of tverskaya street for example are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of tsarist times ostankino palace kuskovo uzkoye and other large estates just outside moscow originally belong to nobles from the tsarist era and some both inside and outside the city are open to muscovites and tourists attempts are being made to restore many of the city s best kept examples of pre soviet architecture these restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless fa√ßades there are a few examples of notable early soviet avant garde work too such as the house of the architect konstantin melnikov in the arbat area many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity facadism is also widely practiced later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi modernist styles employed such as with the novy arbat project familiarly known as false teeth of moscow and notorious for the wide scale disruption of a historic area in central moscow involved in the project plaques on house exteriors will inform passers by that a well known personality once lived there frequently the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well known outside or often like with decorated generals and revolutionaries now both inside of russia there are also many museum houses of famous russian writers composers and artists in the city moscow s skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction in recent years the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings as much as a third of historic moscow has been destroyed in the past few years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels other historical buildings including such landmarks as the moskva hotel and the department store voyentorg have been razed and reconstructed anew with the inevitable loss of historical value critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws in the last years more than buildings with monument status were torn down several of those dating back to the 17th century some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures which include many works by architect konstantin melnikov and mayakovskaya metro station some organizations such as moscow architecture preservation society and save europe s heritage are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems there are parks and gardens in moscow including four botanical gardens there are of green zones besides of forests moscow is a very green city if compared to other cities of comparable size in western europe and north

part of moscow moscow metro system is famous for its art murals mosaics and ornate chandeliers it started operation in and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system more than that it was a stalinist device to awe and reward the populace and give them an appreciation of soviet realist art it became the prototype for future soviet large scale technologies lazar kaganovich was in charge he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of stalinist civilisation as they rode the artwork of the original stations became nationally and internationally famous for example the sverdlov square subway station featured porcelain bas reliefs depicting the daily life of the soviet peoples and the bas reliefs at the dynamo stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new homo sovieticus soviet man the metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order a sort of communist cathedral of engineering modernity soviet workers did the labour and the art work but the main engineering designs routes and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the london underground the britons called for tunnelling instead of the cut and cover technique the use of escalators instead of lifts and designed the routes and the rolling stock the paranoia of stalin and the nkvd was evident when the secret police arrested numerous british engineers for espionage that is for gaining an in depth knowledge of the city s physical layout engineers for the metropolitan vickers electrical company

associated with ancient egypt as the famous giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of memphis are located in its geographical area located near the nile delta modern cairo was founded in ce by the fatimid dynasty but the land composing the present day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of old cairo cairo has long been a centre of the region s political and cultural life and is titled the city of a thousand minarets for its preponderance of islamic architecture cairo is considered a world city with a beta classification according to gawc cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the arab world as well as the world s second oldest institution of higher learning al azhar university many international media businesses and organizations have regional headquarters in the city the arab league has had its headquarters in cairo for most of its existence with a population of over million spread over cairo is by far the largest city in egypt an additional million inhabitants live in close proximity to the city cairo like many other megacities suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic cairo s metro one of two in africa the other being in algiers algeria ranks among the fifteen busiest in the world with over billion annual passenger rides the economy of cairo was ranked first in the middle east in and 43rd globally on foreign policy global cities index egyptians often refer to cairo as the egyptian arabic name for egypt itself emphasizing the city s importance for the country its official name means the vanquisher or the conqueror supposedly due to the fact that the planet mars an najm al qƒÅhir the conquering star was rising at the time when the city was founded possibly also in reference to the much awaited arrival of the fatimid caliph al mu izz who reached cairo in from mahdia the old fatimid capital the location of the ancient city of heliopolis is the suburb of ain shams eye of the sun the coptic name of the city is kashromi which means man breaker ‚≤ï‚≤Åœ£ to break ‚≤£‚≤±‚≤ô‚≤ì man which is akin to arabic sometimes the city is informally referred to as by people from alexandria the area around present day cairo especially memphis that was the old capital of egypt had long been a focal point of ancient egypt due to its strategic location just upstream from the nile delta however the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium around the turn of the 4th century as memphis was continuing to decline in importance the romans established a fortress town along the east bank of the nile this fortress known as babylon was the nucleus of the roman and then the byzantine city and is the oldest structure in the city today it is also situated at the nucleus of the coptic orthodox community which separated from the roman and byzantine churches in the late 4th century many of cairo s oldest coptic churches including the hanging church are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as coptic cairo following the muslim conquest in ad the conqueror amr ibn as settled to the north of the babylon in an area that became known as al fustat originally a tented camp fustat signifies city of tents fustat became a permanent settlement and the first capital of islamic egypt in following the overthrow of the ummayad caliphate by the abbasids the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of fustat which became their capital this was known as al askar the city of sections or cantonments as it was laid out like a military camp a rebellion in by ahmad ibn tulun led to the abandonment of al askar and the building of another settlement which became the seat of government this was al qatta i the quarters to the north of fustat and closer to the river al qatta i was centred around a palace and ceremonial mosque now known as the mosque of ibn tulun in the abbasids re asserted control of the country and their governor returned to fustat razing al qatta i to the ground since 1860s cairo expanded west as far as what is called now midan opera in the fatimids were led by general jawhar al siqilli to establish a new capital for the fatimid dynasty egypt was conquered from their base in ifriqiya and a new fortified city northeast of fustat was established it took four years to build the city initially known as al man·π£≈´riyyah which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate during that time jawhar also commissioned the construction of the al azhar mosque by order of the caliph which developed into the third oldest university in the world cairo would eventually become a centre of learning with the library of cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books when caliph al mu izz li din allah arrived from the old fatimid capital of mahdia in tunisia in he gave the city its present name al qƒÅhiratu the victorious for nearly years after cairo was established the administrative centre of egypt remained in fustat however in the fatimids under the leadership of vizier shawar set fire to fustat to prevent cairo s capture by the crusaders egypt s capital was permanently moved to cairo which was eventually expanded to include the ruins of fustat and the previous capitals of al askar and al qatta i as al qahira expanded these earlier settlements were encompassed and have since become part of the city of cairo as it expanded and spread they are now collectively known as old cairo while the fustat fire successfully protected the city of cairo a continuing power struggle between shawar king amalric i of jerusalem and the zengid general shirkuh led to the downfall of the fatimid establishment in saladin was appointed as the new vizier of egypt by the fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last fatimid caliph al ƒÅ·∏çid as the first sultan of egypt saladin established the ayyubid dynasty based in cairo and aligned egypt with the abbasids who were based in baghdad during his reign saladin constructed the cairo citadel which served as the seat of the egyptian government until the mid 19th century in slave soldiers known as the mamluks seized control of egypt and like many of their predecessors established cairo as the capital of their new dynasty continuing a practice started by the ayyubids much of the land occupied by former fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings construction projects initiated by the mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city meanwhile cairo flourished as a centre of islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in afro eurasia by cairo had a population of close to half a million making it the largest city west of china the historic traveler ibn battuta traveled thousands of miles during the course of his trek one city he stopped in was cairo egypt one significant note ibn battuta made was that cairo was the principal district of egypt meaning cairo was egypt s most important and most influential city ibn battuta ibn battuta also acknowledges the importance of the nile river to all of egypt including cairo as he often traveled via boat to arrive at cairo and to leave to continue his journey the nile was not just a means for transportation it was the source of a plethora of other tangibles as well the nile s most influential attribute was its ability to sustain rich soil for agriculture part of the agricultural revolution thrived in egypt predominantly off the back of the nile the nile also served as a source of food and a pathway for trade without it the egypt we know today wouldn t have been the same one of ibn battuta s most detailed accounts in cairo involves a plague that was devastating the city today this plague is known as the bubonic plague or the black death it is believed to have arrived in egypt in and as ibn battuta recalls the bubonic plague was responsible for the deaths of between and people a day in cairo berkeley orias ibn battuta the plague originated in asia and spread via flees on rodents such as rats berkeley orias the plague would end up spreading to all of eurasia and wiped out any civilizations that were in its path it is estimated that somewhere between and million people total died from the plague although cairo avoided europe s stagnation during the late middle ages it could not escape the black death which struck the city more than fifty times between and during its initial and most deadly waves approximately people were killed by the plague and by the 15th century cairo s population had been reduced to between and the city s status was further diminished after vasco da gama discovered a sea route around the cape of good hope between and thereby allowing spice traders to avoid cairo cairo s political influence diminished significantly after the ottomans supplanted mamluk power over egypt in ruling from constantinople sultan selim i relegated egypt to a province with cairo as its capital for this reason the history of cairo during ottoman times is often described as inconsequential especially in comparison to other time periods however during the 16th and 17th centuries cairo remained an important economic and cultural centre although no longer on the spice route the city facilitated the transportation of yemeni coffee and indian textiles primarily to anatolia north africa and the balkans cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren hejaz especially during the annual hajj to mecca it was during this same period that al azhar university reached the predominance among islamic schools that it continues to hold today pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution which had become associated with egypt s body of islamic scholars by the 16th century cairo also had high rise apartment buildings where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants under the ottomans cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the citadel the city was the second largest in the empire behind constantinople and although migration was not the primary source of cairo s growth twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the mediterranean still when napoleon arrived in cairo in the city s population was less than forty percent lower than it was at the height of mamluk and cairene influence in the mid 14th century the french occupation was short lived as british and ottoman forces including a sizeable albanian contingent recaptured the country in cairo itself was besieged by a british and ottoman force culminating with the french surrender on june the british vacated egypt two years later leaving the ottomans the albanians and the long weakened mamluks jostling for control of the country continued civil war allowed an albanian named muhammad ali pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually with the approval of the religious establishment viceroy of egypt in until his death in muhammad ali pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern egypt however while muhammad ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city those reforms had minimal effect on cairo s landscape bigger changes came to cairo under isma il pasha r who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather drawing inspiration from paris isma il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues due to financial constraints only some of them in the area now composing downtown cairo came to fruition isma il also sought to modernize the city which was merging with neighboring settlements by establishing a public works ministry bringing gas and lighting to the city and opening a theater and opera house the immense debt resulting from isma il s projects provided a pretext for increasing european control which culminated with the british invasion in the city s economic centre quickly moved west toward the nile away from the historic islamic cairo section and toward the contemporary european style areas built by isma il europeans accounted for five percent of cairo s population at the end of the 19th century by which point they held most top governmental positions the british occupation was intended to be temporary but it lasted well into the 20th century nationalists staged large scale demonstrations in cairo in five years after egypt had been declared a british protectorate nevertheless while this led to egypt s independence in british troops remained in the country until during this time urban cairo spurred by new bridges and transport links continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of garden

saturday which saw the destruction of nearly shops movie theatres casinos and hotels in downtown cairo the british departed cairo following the egyptian revolution of but the city s rapid growth showed no signs of abating seeking to accommodate the increasing population president gamal abdel nasser redeveloped maidan tahrir and the nile corniche and improved the city s network of bridges and highways meanwhile additional controls of the nile fostered development within gezira island and along the city s waterfront the metropolis began to encroach on the fertile nile delta prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city dwellers to move to them cairo s population has doubled since the 1960s reaching close to seven million with an additional ten

still holds major importance many things have changed since ibn battuta trekked through the city during his travels today cairo has taken a major step forward in urbanization as most cairenes now live in apartment buildings because of the influx of people in the city lone standing houses are rare to find and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people in fact lone standing houses are symbolic of the wealthy formal education has also become very important to those in the city of cairo just as in the united states there are twelve years of formal education

most of it does come from cairo as the majority of the countries manufacturing headquarters are located there today s cairo has clearly evolved since ibn battuta made his way through the ancient city

concern greater cairo s volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities air quality measurements in cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead carbon dioxide sulphur dioxide and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions urban industrial operations and chaff and trash burning there are over cars on the streets of cairo of which are over years old and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets which create a bowl effect in recent years a mysterious black cloud as egyptians refer to it appeared over cairo every autumn and causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city s citizens tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care cairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city the results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels it is estimated that to people a year in cairo die due to air pollution related diseases lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children in the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels which are very high the city also suffers from a high level of land pollution cairo produces tons of waste material each day tons of which is not collected or managed this once again is a huge health hazard and the egyptian government is looking for ways to combat this the cairo cleaning and beautification agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste however they also work with the zabbaleen or zabaleen a community that has been collecting and recycling cairo s waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as manshiyat naser both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits though it remains a pressing problem the city also suffers from water pollution as the sewer system tends to fail and overflow on occasion sewage has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard this problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the european union which could cope with the demand of the city the dangerously high levels of mercury in the city s water system has global health officials concerned over related health risks as previously mentioned the arab league headquarters is located in cairo cairo has sister city agreements with eight cities in six different countries

rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city s√£o paulo is practically all served by the water supply network the city consumes an average of liters of water inhabitant day while the

to other cities such as caieiras and guarulhos recycling accounts for about of the tonnes of waste produced daily s√£o paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics the original nuclei of the city are vertical characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services and the peripheries are generally developed with two to four story buildings although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis compared to other global cities such as the island cities of new york city and hong kong however s√£o paulo is considered a low rise building city its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories and the average residential building is twenty nevertheless it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings emporis buildings besides possessing what was considered until the tallest skyscraper of the country the mirante do vale also known as pal√°cio zarzur kogan with meters of height and floors such tissue heterogeneity however is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents drug trafficking street vending and prostitution which encouraged the creation of new socio economic centralities the characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century with the relocation of industries to other cities or states several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas the constant change of the landscape of s√£o paulo due to the technological changes of its buildings has been a striking feature of the city pointed out by scholars in a period of a century between the middle of and the city of s√£o paulo was practically demolished and rebuilt at least three times these three periods are characterized by the typical constructive processes of their times s√£o paulo has a history of actions projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of antonio da silva prado baron duprat washington and luis francisco prestes maia however in general the city was formed during the 20th century growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl urban growth in s√£o paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century according to urban historians since the late 19th century and until the 1940s s√£o paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing from the 1940s to the 1980s s√£o paulo followed a model of center periphery social segregation in which the upper and middle classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious self built housing in the periphery and from the 1980s onward new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security thus s√£o paulo differs considerably from other brazilian cities such as belo horizonte and goi√¢nia whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan or a city like bras√≠lia whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction the effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes in s√£o paulo until the mid 1950s the plans were based on the idea of demolish and rebuild including former mayor prestes maia s√£o paulo s road plan known as the avenues plan or saturnino de brito s plan for the tiet√™ river the plan of the avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts this plan included renewing the commercial city center leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods the plan also led to the expansion of bus services which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system this contributed to the outwards expansion of s√£o paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self built single family houses in the urban development plan proposed the basic plan for integrated development of s√£o paulo under the administration of figueiredo ferraz the main result was zoning laws it lasted until when the basic plan was replaced by the current master plan that zoning adopted in designated z1 areas residential areas designed for elites and z3 a mixed zone lacking clear definitions about their characteristics zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation after the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved driving land prices up the poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase their lot and build their house and were forced to look for a housing alternative as a result favelas and precarious tenements corti√ßos appeared these housing types were often located closer to the center of the city favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized often dangerous or unsanitary and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city favelas went back into the urban perimeter occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization alongside polluted rivers railways or between bridges by of s√£o paulo s population lived in favelas compared to in today it is estimated that million paulistas live in favelas which represents about of the total population of the metropolitan area s√£o paulo has public and private primary

estuary its name was changed to when it became the imperial capital with the arrival of emperor meiji in in line with the east asian tradition of including the word capital in the name of the capital city like kyoto beijing and nanjing during the early meiji period the city was also called t≈çkei an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing tokyo making it a kanji homograph some surviving official english documents use the spelling tokei however this pronunciation is now obsolete the name tokyo was first suggested in in the book secret plan of commingling written by sat≈ç nobuhiro when ≈çkubo toshimichi proposed the renaming to the government during the meiji restoration according to oda kanshi ÁπîÁî∞ÂÆå‰πã he got the idea from that book tokyo was originally a small fishing village named edo in what was formerly part of the old musashi province edo was first fortified by the edo clan in the late twelfth century in ≈çta d≈çkan built edo castle in tokugawa ieyasu was transferred from mikawa province his lifelong base to kant≈ç region when he became sh≈çgun in edo became the center of his ruling during the subsequent edo period edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century but edo was tokugawa s home and was not capital of japan that was caused by the meiji restoration in the emperor himself lived in kyoto from to as capital of japan during the edo era the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the pax tokugawa and in the presence of such peace edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city the absence of war inflicted devastation allowed edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires earthquakes and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city however this prolonged period of seclusion came to an end with the arrival of american commodore matthew c perry in commodore perry negotiated the opening of the ports of shimoda and hakodate leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations especially in the form of the smashing of rice establishments meanwhile supporters of the meiji emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last tokugawa sh≈çgun yoshinobu in after years the pax tokugawa came to an end in the year old emperor meiji moved to edo and in accordance the city was renamed tokyo meaning eastern capital the city was divided into yamanote and shitamachi tokyo was already the nation s political and cultural center and the emperor s residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well with the former edo castle becoming the imperial palace the city of tokyo was officially established on may central tokyo like osaka has been designed since about to be centered on major railway stations in a high density fashion so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right of way though expressways have been built in tokyo the basic design has not changed tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century the great kant≈ç earthquake which left dead or missing and world war ii in the city of tokyo merged with the prefecture of tokyo to form the metropolitan prefecture of tokyo since then the tokyo metropolitan government served as both the prefecture government for tokyo as well as administering the special wards of tokyo for what had previously been

bombs rained on the eastern half of the city mainly in heavily residential wards two fifths of the city were completely burned more than buildings were demolished civilians were killed and more were injured between and the population of japan s capital city dwindled from to less than with the majority of those who lost their homes living in ramshackle makeshift huts after the war tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the summer olympics the 1970s brought new high rise developments such as sunshine a new and controversial airport at narita in some distance outside city limits and a population increase to about million in the metropolitan area tokyo s subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world as more and more people moved to the area in the 1980s real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble the bubble burst in the early 1990s and many companies banks and individuals were caught with mortgage backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value a major recession followed making the 1990s japan s lost decade from which it is now slowly recovering tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land recent projects include ebisu garden place tennozu isle shiodome roppongi hills shinagawa now also a shinkansen station and the marunouchi side of tokyo station buildings

with swaying as if in a boat although epicenters within mainland tokyo excluding tokyo s km long island jurisdiction are quite rare it is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes magnitudes that can be felt in a single year something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety to not only to foreign visitors but japanese from elsewhere as well they rarely cause much damage sometimes a few injuries as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent chiba and ibaraki tokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in and much more indirectly some liquefaction in landfill zones in the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity

of the spanish colonial empire after independence from spain was achieved the federal district was created in after years of demanding greater political autonomy residents were finally given the right to elect both a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral legislative assembly by election in ever since the left wing party of the democratic revolution prd has controlled both of them the city has several progressive policies such as abortion on request a limited form of euthanasia no fault divorce and same sex marriage on january it ceased to be the federal district spanish distrito federal or d f and is now officially known as ciudad de m√©xico or cdmx mexico city is now in transition to become the country s 32nd federal entity which gives it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state a clause in the constitution of mexico however prevents it from becoming a state as it is the seat of power in the country unless the capital of the country were relocated elsewhere the city of mexico tenochtitlan was founded by the mexica people in the old mexica city that is now simply referred to as tenochtitlan was built on an island in the center of the inland lake system of the valley of mexico which it shared with a smaller city state called tlatelolco according to legend the mexicas principal god huitzilopochtli indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting a golden eagle perched on a prickly pear devouring a rattlesnake between and tenochtitlan grew in size and strength eventually dominating the other city states around lake texcoco and in the valley of mexico when the spaniards arrived the aztec empire had reached much of mesoamerica touching both the gulf of mexico and the pacific ocean after landing in veracruz spanish explorer hern√°n cort√©s advanced upon tenochtitlan with the aid of many of the other native peoples arriving there on november cort√©s and his men marched along the causeway leading into the city from iztapalapa and the city s ruler moctezuma ii greeted the spaniards they exchanged gifts but the camaraderie did not last long cort√©s put moctezuma under house arrest hoping to rule through him tensions increased until on the night of june during a struggle known as la noche triste the aztecs rose up against the spanish intrusion and managed to capture or drive out the europeans and their tlaxcalan allies cort√©s regrouped at tlaxcala the aztecs thought the spaniards were permanently gone and they elected a new king cuitl√°huac but he soon died the next king was cuauht√©moc cort√©s began a siege of tenochtitlan in may for three months the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of smallpox brought by the europeans cort√©s and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and slowly fought their way through the city cuauht√©moc surrendered in august the spaniards practically razed tenochtitlan during the final siege of the conquest cort√©s first settled in coyoac√°n but decided to rebuild the aztec site to erase all traces of the old order he did not establish a territory under his own personal rule but remained loyal to the spanish crown the first spanish viceroy arrived in mexico city fourteen years later by that time the city had again become a city state having power that extended far beyond its borders although the spanish preserved tenochtitlan s basic layout they built catholic churches over the old aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves tenochtitlan was renamed mexico because the spanish found the word easier to pronounce the city had been the capital of the aztec empire and in the colonial era mexico city became the capital of new spain the viceroy of mexico or vice king lived in the viceregal palace on the main square or z√≥calo the mexico city metropolitan cathedral the seat of the archbishopric of new spain was constructed on another side of the z√≥calo as was the archbishop s palace and across from it the building housing the city council or ayuntamiento of the city a famous late seventeenth century painting of the z√≥calo by crist√≥bal de villalpando depicts the main square which had been the old aztec ceremonial center the existing central place of the aztecs was effectively and permanently transformed to the ceremonial center and seat of power during the colonial period and remains to this day in modern mexico the central place of the nation the rebuilding of the city after the siege of tenochtitlan was accomplished by the abundant indigenous labor in the surrounding area franciscan friar toribio de benavente motolinia one of the twelve apostles of mexico who arrived in new spain in described the rebuilding of the city as one of the afflictions or plagues of the early period the seventh plague was the construction of the great city of mexico which during the early years used more people than in the construction of jerusalem the crowds of laborers were so numerous that one could hardly move in the streets and causeways although they are very wide many died from being crushed by beams or falling from high places or in tearing down old buildings for new ones preconquest tenochtitlan was built in the center of the inland lake system with the city reachable by canoe and by wide causeways to the mainland the causeways were rebuilt under spanish rule with indigenous labor colonial spanish cities were constructed on a grid pattern if no geographical obstacle prevented it in mexico city the z√≥calo main square was the central place from which the grid was then built outward the spanish lived in the area closest to the main square in what was known as the traza in orderly well laid out streets indian residences were outside that exclusive zone and houses were haphazardly located spaniards sought to keep indians separate from spaniards but since the z√≥calo was a center of commerce for indians they were a constant presence in the central area so strict segregation was never enforced at intervals z√≥calo was where major celebrations took place as well as executions it was also the site of two major riots in the seventeenth century one in the other in the city grew as the population did coming up against the lake s waters as the depth of the lake water fluctuated mexico city was subject to periodic flooding a major labor draft the desag√ºe compelled thousands of indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard since during flood periods human waste polluted the city s streets by draining the area the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread however draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indian cultivation close to the capital the 16th century saw a proliferation of churches many of which can still be seen today in the historic center economically mexico city prospered as a result of trade unlike brazil or peru mexico had easy contact with both the atlantic and pacific worlds although the spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city it had only partial success the concept of nobility flourished in new spain in a way not seen in other parts of the americas spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it in the ensuing centuries possession of a noble title in mexico did not mean one exercised great political power for one s power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not the concept of nobility in mexico was not political but rather a very conservative spanish social one based on proving the worthiness of the family most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in new spain outside of the city itself then spending the revenues in the capital building churches supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes the craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century many of these palaces can still be seen today leading to mexico city s nickname of the city of palaces given by alexander von humboldt the grito de dolores cry of dolores also known as el grito de la independencia cry of independence marked the beginning of the mexican war of independence the battle of guanajuato the first major engagement of the insurgency occurred four days later after a decade of war mexico s independence from spain was effectively declared in the declaration of independence of the mexican empire on september unrest followed for the next several decades as different factions fought for control of mexico the mexican federal district was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution where the concept of a federal district was adapted from the united states constitution before this designation mexico city had served as the seat of government for both the state of mexico and the nation as a whole texcoco and then toluca became the capital of the state of mexico the battle for mexico city was the series of engagements from september to in the general vicinity of mexico city during the u s mexican war included are major actions at the battles of molino del rey and chapultepec culminating with the fall of mexico city the u s army under winfield scott scored a major success that ended the war the american invasion into the federal district was first resisted during the battle of churubusco on august where the saint patrick s battalion which was composed primarily of catholic irish and german immigrants but also canadians english french italians poles scots spaniards swiss and mexican people fought for the mexican cause repelling the american attacks after defeating the saint patrick s battalion the mexican american war came to a close after the united states deployed combat units deep into mexico resulting in the capture of mexico city and veracruz by the u s army s 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th divisions the invasion culminated with the storming of chapultepec castle in the city itself during this battle on september the 4th division under john a quitman spearheaded the attack against chapultepec and carried the castle future confederate generals george e pickett and james longstreet participated in the attack serving in the mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as los ni√±os h√©roes the boy heroes the mexican forces fell back from chapultepec and retreated within the city attacks on the bel√©n and san cosme gates came afterwards the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city events such as the mexican american war the french intervention and the reform war left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow especially during the rule of president porfirio d√≠az during this time the city developed a modern infrastructure such as roads schools transportation systems and communication systems however the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest of the country languished in poverty under the rule of porfirio d√≠az mexico city experienced a massive transformation d√≠az s goal was to create a city which could rival the great european cities he and his government came to the conclusion that they would use paris as a model while still containing remnants of amerindian and hispanic elements this style of mexican french fusion architecture became colloquially known as porfirian architecture porfirian architecture became very influenced by paris haussmannization during this era of porfirian rule the city underwent an extensive modernization many spanish colonial style buildings were destroyed replaced by new much larger porfirian institutions and many outlying rural zones were transformed into urban or industrialized districts with most having electrical gas and sewage utilities by while the initial focus was on developing modern hospitals schools factories and massive public works perhaps the most long lasting effects of the porfirian modernization were creation of the colonia roma area and the development of reforma avenue many of mexico city s major attractions and landmarks were built during this era in this style diaz s plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the porfirian french style of the colonia roma but the mexican revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition with many projects being left half completed one of the best examples of this is the monument to the mexican revolution originally the monument was to be the main dome of diaz s new senate hall but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many mexicans that the porfirian era was over once and for all and as such it was turned into a monument to victory over diaz the capital escaped the worst of the violence of the ten year conflict of the mexican revolution the most significant episode of this period for the city was the february la decena tr√°gica the ten tragic days when forces counter to the elected government of francisco i madero staged a successful coup the center of the city was subjected to artillery attacks from the army stronghold of the ciudadela or citadel with significant civilian casualties and the undermining of confidence in the madero government victoriano huerta chief general of the federal army saw a chance to take power forcing madero and pino suarez to sign resignations the two were murdered later while on their way to lecumberri prison huerta s ouster in july saw the entry of the armies of pancho villa and emiliano zapata but the city did not experience violence huerta had abandoned the capital and the conquering armies marched in venustiano carranza s constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and carranza took up residence in the presidential palace the history of the rest of the 20th century to the present focuses on the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences in the population of mexico city was about the city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s with the torre latinoamericana becoming the city s first skyscraper the olympic games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities in the metro system was inaugurated explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s with the population overflowing the boundaries of the federal district into the neighboring state of mexico especially to the north northwest and northeast between and the city s population more than doubled to nearly million in half of all the industrial jobs in mexico were located in mexico city under relentless growth the mexico city government could barely keep up with services villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city s problems with no housing available they took over lands surrounding the city creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles this caused serious air pollution in mexico city and water pollution problems as well as subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation the autocratic government that ruled mexico city since the revolution was tolerated mostly because of the continued economic expansion since world war ii this was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately nevertheless discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in tlatelolco three years later a demonstration in the maestros avenue organized by former members of the student movement was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called los halcones composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the u s on thursday september at am cst mexico city was struck by an earthquake of magnitude on the richter magnitude scale although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in asia and other parts of latin america it proved to be a disaster politically for the one party government the government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well however the last straw may have been the controversial elections of that year the presidency was set between the p r i s candidate carlos salinas de gortari and a coalition of left wing parties led by cuauht√©moc c√°rdenas son of the former president l√°zaro c√°rdenas the counting system fell because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly when it returned the winning candidate was salinas even though c√°rdenas had the upper hand as a result of the fraudulent election c√°rdenas became a member of the party of the democratic revolution discontent over the election eventually led cuauht√©moc c√°rdenas to become the first elected mayor of mexico city in c√°rdenas promised a more democratic government and his party claimed some victories against crime pollution and other major problems he resigned in to run for the presidency mexico city is located in the valley of mexico sometimes called the basin of mexico this valley is located in the trans mexican volcanic belt in the high plateaus of south central mexico it has a minimum altitude of above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over this valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides making the city vulnerable to flooding drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century mexico city primarily rests on what was lake texcoco seismic activity is frequent here lake texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century although none of the lake waters remain the city rests on the lake bed s heavily saturated clay this soft base is collapsing due to the over extraction of groundwater called groundwater related subsidence since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as in some areas this sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management leading to flooding problems especially during the rainy season the entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city s remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of milpa alta tlalpan and xochimilco mexico city has a subtropical highland climate k√∂ppen climate classification cwb due to its tropical location but high elevation the lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south the lower boroughs of iztapalapa iztacalco venustiano carranza and the east portion of gustavo a madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of tlalpan and milpa alta a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of ajusco the average annual temperature varies from depending on the altitude of the borough the temperature is rarely below or above at the tacubaya observatory the lowest temperature ever registered was on february and the highest temperature on record was on may overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months and includes dense hail it does not snow in the city only in nearby mountain tops but in the past this was not the case throughout its history the central valley of mexico used to have several snowfalls per decade including a period between and in which every single year except recorded snowfalls mostly by lake effect snow but the draining of lake texcoco and also global warming restricted the snowfalls after the snowstorm of february following that year snow has only occurred on january on march and for the last time on january coinciding with the operation of deep drainage system that resulted in the total draining of what was left of lake texcoco the region of the valley of mexico receives anti cyclonic systems the weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion outside the basin of the air pollutants which are produced by the industries and million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area the area receives about of annual rainfall which is concentrated from june through september october with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year the area has two main seasons the rainy season runs from june to october when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea the wettest month being july the dry season runs from november to may when the air is relatively drier the driest month being december this dry season is subdivided into a cold period and a warm period the cold period spans from november to february when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry the warm period extends from march to may when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain to form originally much of the valley laid beneath the waters of lake texcoco a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes the aztecs built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in chinampas and to prevent recurrent floods these dikes were destroyed during the siege of tenochtitlan and during colonial times the spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods only a small section of the original lake remains located outside mexico city in the municipality of atenco state of mexico architects teodoro gonz√°lez de le√≥n and alberto kalach along with a group of mexican urbanists engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for recovering the city of lakes if approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the valley of mexico the creation of new natural spaces a great improvement in air quality and greater population establishment planning by the 1990s mexico city had become infamous as one of the world s most polluted cities however the city has become a model for dramatically lowering pollution levels by carbon monoxide pollution had dropped dramatically while levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were nearly three times lower than in the levels of signature pollutants in mexico city are similar to those of los angeles despite the cleanup the metropolitan area is still the most ozone polluted part of the country with ozone levels times beyond who defined safe limits to clean up pollution the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions such as ozone and nitrogen oxides when the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories changing school hours and extending the a day without a car program to two days of the week the government also instituted industrial technology improvements a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels the introduction of metrob√∫s bus rapid transit and the ecobici bike sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate greener forms of transportation the acta constitutiva de la federaci√≥n of january and the federal constitution of october fixed the political and administrative organization of the united mexican states after the mexican war of independence in addition section xxviii of article gave the new congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located this location would then be appropriated as federal land with the federal government acting as the local authority the two main candidates to become the capital were mexico city and quer√©taro due in large part to the persuasion of representative servando teresa de mier mexico city was chosen because it was the center of the country s population and history even though quer√©taro was closer to the center geographically the choice was official on november and congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square acres centered on the zocalo this area was then separated from the state of mexico forcing that state s government to move from the palace of the inquisition now museum of mexican medicine in the city to texcoco this area did not include the population centers of the towns of coyoac√°n xochimilco mexicaltzingo and tlalpan all of which remained as part of the state of mexico in president antonio l√≥pez de santa anna enlarged the area of mexico city almost eightfold from the original annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion the mexican american war had just been fought the last changes to the limits of mexico city were made between and reducing the area to the current by adjusting the southern border with the state of morelos by that time the total number of municipalities within mexico city was twenty two while mexico city was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor the municipalities within it were autonomous and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century in porfirio d√≠az largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district eventually in december the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district in place of the municipalities the federal district was divided into one central department and delegaciones boroughs administered directly by the government of the federal district the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city tacuba tacubaya and mixcoac in the general anaya borough was merged to the central department which was then renamed mexico city thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality from to the federal district comprised twelve delegaciones and mexico city in mexico city was split into four different delegaciones cuauht√©moc miguel hidalgo venustiano carranza and benito ju√°rez increasing the number of delegaciones to since then the whole federal district whose delegaciones had by then almost formed a single urban area began to be considered de facto a synonym of mexico city the lack of a de jure stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether in the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the constitution of mexico mexico city and the federal district were stated to be the same entity the amendment was later introduced into the second article of the statute of government of the federal district on january mexico city ceased to be the federal district spanish distrito federal or d f the former distrito federal is now officially known as ciudad de m√©xico or cdmx mexico city is now in transition to become the country s 32nd federal entity giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state because of a clause in the mexican constitution however as it is the seat of the powers of the federation it can never become a state or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere mexico city being the seat of the powers of the union belongs not to any particular state but to all of them therefore the president representing the federation used to designate the head of government of the federal district today the head of the government of mexico city sometimes called outside mexico as the mayor of mexico city in the 1980s the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades the inherent political inconsistencies of the system and dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the earthquake made residents begin to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs some political groups even proposed that the federal district be converted into the 32nd state of the federation in response to the demands mexico city received a greater degree of autonomy with the elaboration the first statute of government estatuto de gobierno and the creation of an assembly of representatives in the 1990s this autonomy was further expanded and since residents can directly elect the head of government of the federal district and the representatives of a unicameral legislative assembly which succeeded the previous assembly by popular vote the first elected head of government was cuauht√©moc c√°rdenas he resigned in to run in the presidential elections and designated rosario robles to succeed him who became the first woman elected or otherwise to govern mexico city in andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador was elected and he resigned in to run in the presidential elections alejandro encinas was designated by the legislative assembly to finish the term in marcelo ebrard was elected to serve until the city does not have a constitution unlike the states of the union but it has a statute of government as part of the recent changes in autonomy the budget is administered locally it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the legislative assembly nonetheless it is the congress of the union that sets the ceiling to internal and external public debt issued by the city government according to the 44th article of the mexican constitution if the powers of the union move to another city mexico city would become a new state the state of the valley of mexico with the new limits set by the congress of the union in elections were held for the post of head of government and the representatives of the legislative assembly heads of government are elected for a six year period without the possibility of re election traditionally the position has been considered as the second most important executive office in the country the legislative assembly of mexico city is formed as it is the case for state legislatures in mexico by both single seat and proportional seats making it a system of parallel voting mexico city is divided into electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by the plurality voting system locally called uninominal deputies mexico city as a whole is a single constituency for the parallel election of representatives elected by proportional representation with open party lists locally called plurinominal deputies even though proportionality is supposed to prevent a party from being overrepresented several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats no party can have more than of all seats both uninominal and plurinominal in the elections the prd got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections securing of the fpp seats as such the prd was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents over representation the overall composition of the legislative assembly is the politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in mexico city since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country whether with the support of the federal government as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s or by laws that were since approved by the legislative assembly the legislative assembly expanded provisions on abortions becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy in december the then federal district became the first city in latin america and one of very few in the world to legalize same sex marriage for administrative purposes the federal district is divided into delegaciones or boroughs while they are not fully equivalent to municipalities the boroughs have gained significant autonomy and since their heads of government have been elected directly by plurality they had been appointed by the head of government of the federal district since mexico city is organized entirely as a federal district most of the city services are provided or organized by the government of the federal district not by the boroughs themselves in the constituent states such services would be provided by the municipalities the boroughs of mexico city with their populations are the boroughs are composed by hundreds of colonias or neighborhoods which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation the historic center in the borough of cuauht√©moc is the oldest part of the city along with some other formerly separate colonial towns such as coyoac√°n and san √°ngel some of the buildings dating back to the 16th century other well known central neighborhoods include condesa known for its art deco architecture and its restaurant scene colonia roma a beaux arts neighborhood and artistic and culinary hot spot the zona rosa formerly the center of nightlife and restaurants now reborn as the center of the lgbt and korean mexican communities and tepito and la lagunilla known for their local working class foklore and large flea markets santa mar√≠a la ribera and san rafael are the latest neighborhoods of magnificent porfiriato architecture seeing the first signs of gentrification west of the historic center centro hist√≥rico along paseo de la reforma are many of the city s wealthiest neighborhoods such as polanco lomas de chapultepec bosques de las lomas santa fe and in the state of mexico interlomas which are also the city s most important areas of class a office space corporate headquarters skyscrapers and shopping malls nevertheless some areas of lower income colonias are right next to rich neighborhoods particularly in the case of santa fe the south of the city is home to some other high income neighborhoods such as colonia del valle and jardines del pedregal and the formerly separate colonial towns of coyoac√°n san √°ngel and san jer√≥nimo along avenida insurgentes from paseo de la reforma near the center south past the world trade center and unam university towards the perif√©rico ring road is another important corridor of corporate office space the far southern boroughs of xochimilco and tl√°huac have a significant rural population with milpa alta being entirely rural east of the center are mostly lower income areas with some middle class neighborhoods such as jard√≠n balbuena urban sprawl continues further east for many miles into the state of mexico including ciudad nezahualcoyotl now increasingly middle class but once full of informal settlements such slums are still found on the eastern edges of the metropolitan area in the chalco area north of the historic center azcapotzalco and gustavo a madero have important industrial centers and neighborhoods that range from established middle class colonias such as claveria and lindavista to huge low income housing areas that share hillsides with adjacent municipalities in the state of mexico in recent years much of northern mexico city s industry has moved to nearby municipalities in the state of mexico northwest of mexico city itself is ciudad sat√©lite a vast middle to upper middle class residential and business area the human development index report of shows that there were three boroughs with a very high human development index with a high hdi value above and one with a medium hdi value almost high benito ju√°rez borough had the highest hdi of the country followed by miguel hidalgo which came up fourth nationally with a hdi of and coyoac√°n was fifth nationally with a hdi of cuajimalpa 15th cuauht√©moc and azcapotzalco 25th also had very high values of respectively and in contrast the boroughs of xochimilco 172nd tl√°huac 177th and iztapalapa 183rd presented the lowest hdi values of mexico city with values of and respectively which are still in the global high hdi range the only borough that did not have a high hdi was that of rural milpa alta which had a medium hdi of far below all of the other boroughs 627th nationally the rest being in the top mexico city s hdi for the report was of very high and its value of very high or by newer methodology was mexico s highest greater mexico city is formed by mexico city municipalities from the state of mexico and one from the state of hidalgo greater mexico city is the largest metropolitan area in mexico and the area with the highest population density people live in this urban agglomeration of which live in mexico city proper in terms of population the biggest municipalities that are part of greater mexico city excluding mexico city proper are the above municipalities are located in the state of mexico but are part of the greater mexico city area approximately million of the state of m√©xico s population live in municipalities that are part of greater mexico city s conurbation greater mexico city was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s since then and through a policy of decentralization in order to reduce the environmental pollutants of the growing conurbation the annual rate of growth of the agglomeration has decreased and it is lower than that of the other four largest metropolitan areas namely greater guadalajara greater monterrey greater puebla and greater toluca even though it is still positive the net migration rate of mexico city proper from to was negative which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area or to other states of mexico in addition some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs indicating the continuing expansion of greater mexico city the secretariat of public security of mexico city secretar√≠a de seguridad p√∫blica de la ciudad de m√©xico ssp manages a combined force of over officers in mexico city the ssp is charged with maintaining public order and safety in the heart of mexico city the historic district is also roamed by tourist police aiming to orient and serve tourists these horse mounted agents dress in traditional uniforms the investigative judicial police of mexico city polic√≠a judicial de la ciudad de m√©xico pjcdmx is organized under the office of the attorney general of mexico city the procuradur√≠a general de justicia de la ciudad de m√©xico the pgjcdmx maintains precincts delegaciones with an estimated judicial police investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys agentes del ministerio p√∫blico and nearly criminology experts or specialists peritos between and an average of crimes were reported each day in mexico city however the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher since most people are reluctant to report crime under policies enacted by mayor marcelo ebrard between and mexico city underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country some of the policies enacted included the installation of security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force mexico city has one of the world s highest police officer to resident ratios with one uniformed officer per citizens since the prison population has increased by more than political scientist markus michael m√ºller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures he sees punishment related to the growing politicisation of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalisation of the people living at the margins of urban society in particular those who work in the city s informal economy mexico city is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country hospital √°ngeles hospital abc and m√©dica sur to name a few the national public healthcare institution for private sector employees imss has its largest facilities in mexico city including the national medical center and the la raza medical center and has an annual budget of over billion pesos the imss and other public health institutions including the issste public sector employees social security institute and the national health ministry ssa maintain large specialty facilities in the city these include the national institutes of cardiology nutrition psychiatry oncology pediatrics rehabilitation among others the world bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories they have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars since all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter which reduces the emissions released trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas lpg also construction of an underground rail system was begun in in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion today it has over of track and carries over million people every day fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women due to these initiatives and others the air quality in mexico city has begun to improve with the air becoming cleaner since when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for days of the year mexico city is one of the most important economic hubs in latin america the city proper produces of the country s gross domestic product according to a study conducted by pwc mexico city had a gdp of billion ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in latin america mexico city alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world mexico city is the greatest contributor to the country s industrial gdp and also the greatest contributor to the country s gdp in the service sector due to the limited non urbanized space at the south most of which is protected through environmental laws the contribution of mexico city in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country mexico city has one of the world s fastest growing economies and its gdp is set to double by in mexico city had a human development index score of identical to that of south korea the top twelve percent of gdp per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of in the high spending power of mexico city inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods the economic reforms of president carlos salinas de gortari had a tremendous effect on the city as a number of businesses including banks and airlines were privatized he also signed the north american free trade agreement nafta this led to decentralization and a shift in mexico city s economic base from manufacturing to services as most factories moved away to either the state of mexico or more commonly to the northern border by contrast corporate office buildings set their base in the city historically and since pre columbian times the valley of anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in mexico when the federal district was created in the urban area of mexico city extended approximately to the area of today s cuauht√©moc borough at the beginning of the 20th century the elites began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of mixcoac and san √°ngel were incorporated by the growing conurbation according to the census of the city s population was considered mestizo indigenous mixed with european considered european and considered indigenous this was the last mexican census which asked people to self identify with an heritage other than amerindian however the census had the particularity that unlike racial ethnic census in other countries it was focused in the perception of cultural heritage rather than in a racial perception leading to a good number of white people to identify with mixed heritage due to cultural influence in mexico city had less than one million inhabitants up to the 1990s the federal district was the most populous federal entity in mexico but since then its population has remained stable at around million the growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the federal district to municipalities of the state of mexico and in the state of hidalgo with a population of approximately million inhabitants it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world nonetheless the annual rate of growth of the metropolitan area of mexico city is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in mexico a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization the net migration rate of mexico city from to was negative representing around of the city s population indigenous peoples from different areas of mexico have migrated to the capital in search of better economic opportunities nahuatl otomi mixtec zapotec and mazahua are the indigenous languages with the greatest number of speakers in mexico city on the other hand mexico city is also home to large communities of expatriates and immigrants most notably from the rest of north america u s and canada from south america mainly from argentina and colombia but also from brazil chile uruguay and venezuela from central america and the caribbean mainly from cuba guatemala el salvador haiti and honduras from europe mainly from spain germany and switzerland but also from czech republic hungary france italy ireland the netherlands poland and romania from the middle east mainly from egypt lebanon and syria and recently from asia pacific mainly from china and south korea historically since the era of new spain many filipinos settled in the city and have become integrated in mexican society while no official figures have been reported population estimates of each of these communities are quite significant mexico city is home to the largest population of u s americans living outside the united states current estimates are as high as u s americans living in mexico city while in the u s bureau of consular affairs estimated over americans lived in the mexico city metropolitan area the majority of the residents in mexico city are roman catholic slightly lower than the census national percentage of though it has been decreasing over the last decades many other religions and philosophies are also practiced in the city many different types of protestant groups different types of jewish communities buddhist islamic and other spiritual and philosophical groups there are also growing numbers of irreligious people whether agnostic or atheist mexico city is a destination for many foreign tourists wikipedia s

 lima lima quechua aymara is the capital and the largest city of peru it is located in the valleys of the chill√≥n r√≠mac and lur√≠n rivers in the central coastal part of the country overlooking the pacific ocean together with the seaport of callao it forms a contiguous urban area known as the lima metropolitan area with a population of more than million lima is the most populous metropolitan area of peru and the third largest city in the americas as defined by city proper behind s√£o paulo and mexico city lima was founded by spanish conquistador francisco pizarro on january as ciudad de los reyes it became the capital and most important city in the spanish viceroyalty of peru following the peruvian war of independence it became the capital of the republic of peru around one third of the national population lives in the metropolitan area lima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the new world the national university of san marcos founded on may during the spanish colonial regime is the oldest continuously functioning university in the americas in october lima was chosen to host the pan american games it also hosted the december united nations climate change conference and the miss universe pageant in october lima hosted the annual meetings of the world bank group and the international monetary fund according to early spanish articles the lima area was once called itchyma after its original inhabitants however even before the inca occupation of the area in the 15th century a famous oracle in the r√≠mac valley had come to be known by visitors as limaq limaq pronounced which means talker or speaker in the coastal quechua that was the area s primary language before the spanish arrival this oracle was eventually destroyed by the spanish and replaced with a church but the name persisted the chronicles show l√≠mac replacing ychma as the common name for the area modern scholars speculate that the word lima originated as the spanish pronunciation of the native name limaq linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken spanish consistently rejects stop consonants in word final position non peruvian spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct spanish translation of lime the citrus fruit the city was founded in under the name city of the kings because its foundation was decided on january date of the feast of the epiphany this name quickly fell into disuse and lima became the city s name of choice on the oldest spanish maps of peru both lima and ciudad de los reyes can be seen together the river that feeds lima is called r√≠mac and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original inca name is talking river the incas spoke a highland variety of quechua in which the word for talker was pronounced however the original inhabitants of the valley were not incas this name is an innovation arising from an effort by the cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of cuzco quechua later as the original inhabitants died out and the local quechua became extinct the cuzco pronunciation prevailed nowadays spanish speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it they often assume that the valley is named after the river however spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true historically the flag of lima has been known as the banner of peru s kings city it is made from a golden colored silk canvas and embroidered in the center is its coat of arms lima s anthem was heard for the first time on january in a formal meeting with important politicians including peruvian president alan garc√≠a and other authorities the anthem was created by luis enrique tord lyrics euding maeshiro music and record producer ricardo n√∫√±ez arranger in the pre columbian era what is now lima was inhabited by indigenous groups under the ychsma policy which was incorporated into the inca empire in the 15th century in a group of spanish conquistadors led by francisco pizarro defeated the inca ruler atahualpa and took over his empire as the spanish crown had named pizarro governor of the lands he conquered he chose the r√≠mac valley to found his capital on january as ciudad de los reyes city of the kings in august rebel inca troops led by manco inca yupanqui besieged the city but were defeated by the spaniards and their native allies lima gained prestige after being designated capital of the viceroyalty of peru and site of a real audiencia in during the next century it flourished as the centre of an extensive trade network that integrated the viceroyalty with the rest of the americas europe and the far east however the city was not free from dangers the presence of pirates and privateers in the pacific ocean lead to the building of the walls of lima between and the peru earthquake destroyed most of the city buildings the earthquake marked a turning point in the city s history as it coincided with a trade recession and growing economic competition with cities such as buenos aires in another powerful earthquake severely damaged lima and destroyed callao forcing a massive rebuilding effort under viceroy jos√© antonio manso de velasco in the later half of the 18th century enlightenment ideas on public health and social control shaped development during this period lima was adversely affected by the bourbon reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and its control over the mining region of upper peru the city s economic decline left its elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus reluctant to advocate independence a combined expedition of argentine and chilean patriots under general jos√© de san mart√≠n landed south of lima in but did not attack the city faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land viceroy jos√© de la serna e hinojosa evacuated its capital in july to save the royalist army fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order the city council invited san mart√≠n to enter lima and signed a declaration of independence at his request however the war was not over in the next two years the city changed hands several times after independence lima became the capital of the republic of peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought urban development to a halt this hiatus ended in the 1850s when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid development of the city the export led expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor fostering social unrest during the war of the pacific chilean troops occupied lima looting public museums libraries and educational institutions at the same time angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the asian population sacking their properties and businesses the city underwent renewal and expansion from the 1890s to the 1920s during this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of broad avenues that crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns on may an destroyed most of the city which at that time was mostly built of adobe and quincha in the 1940s lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by migration from the andean region as rural people sought opportunities for work and education the population estimated at in reached million by and million by at the start of this period the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city s historic centre callao and chorrillos in the following decades settlements spread to the north beyond the r√≠mac river to the east along the central highway and to the south the new migrants at first confined to slums in downtown lima led this expansion through large scale land invasions which evolved into shanty towns known as pueblos j√≥venes the urban area covers about it is located on mostly flat terrain in the peruvian coastal plain within the valleys of the chill√≥n r√≠mac and lur√≠n rivers the city slopes gently from the shores of the pacific ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as above sea level within the city are isolated hills that are not connected to the surrounding hill chains such as el agustino san cosme el pino la milla muleria and pro hills the san cristobal hill in the r√≠mac district which lies directly north of the downtown area is the local extreme of an andean hill outgrowth metro lima covers of which comprise the actual city and the city outskirts the urban area extends around from north to south and around from west to east the city center is located inland at the shore of the r√≠mac river a vital resource for the city since

is usually considered to be composed of the central of districts of lima province corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic cercado de lima district the city is the core of the lima metro area one of the ten largest metro areas in the americas lima is the world s third largest desert city after karachi pakistan and cairo egypt despite its location in the tropics and in a desert lima s proximity to the cool waters of the pacific ocean leads to temperatures much lower than those expected for a tropical desert and thus lima can be classified as a mild desert climate k√∂ppen bwn with subtropical temperature ranges temperatures rarely fall below or rise above two distinct seasons can be identified summer from december through april and winter from june through october may and november are generally transition months with a more dramatic warm to cool weather transition daily temperatures oscillate between lows of to and highs of to occasional coastal fogs on some mornings and high clouds in some afternoons and evenings can be present summer sunsets are colorful labeled by locals as cielo de brujas spanish for sky of witches since the sky commonly turns shades of orange pink and red around pm winter weather is dramatically different grey skies breezy conditions higher humidity and cooler temperatures prevail long weeks or more stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from june through september coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon winter temperatures vary little between day and night they range from lows of to and highs of to rarely exceeding except in the easternmost districts relative humidity is always very high particularly in the mornings high humidity produces brief morning fog in the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter generally developing in may and persisting into late november or even early december the predominantly onshore flow makes the lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire peruvian coast lima has only hours of sunshine a year hours in july and hours in april which is exceptionally little for the latitude by comparison london has an average of hours of sunshine per year and moscow hours of sunshine per year winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek for sunshine in andean valleys located at elevations generally above meters above sea level while relative humidity is high rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability the severely low rainfall impacts on water supply in the city which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the andes inland districts receive anywhere between and of rainfall per year which accumulates mainly during the winter months coastal districts receive only to as previously mentioned winter precipitation occurs in the form of persistent morning drizzle events these are locally called gar√∫a llovizna or camanchacas summer rain on the other hand is infrequent and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers these generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from andean storms arrive from the east the lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused in turn by the combination of cool waters from semi permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold humboldt current and warm air aloft associated with the south pacific anticyclone lima s climate like that of most of coastal peru gets severely disrupted in el ni√±o events coastal waters usually average around but get much warmer as in when the water reached air temperatures rise accordingly with a municipal population of and for the metropolitan area and a population density of lima ranks as the

of a network of buses that run in exclusive corridors under the bus rapid transit system bst the goal is to reduce passengers commute times protect the environment provide improved security and overall quality of service metropolitano was executed with funds from the city of lima and financing from the inter american development bank and the world bank metropolitana is the first brt system to operate with natural gas seeking to reduce air pollution this system links the principal points of the lima metropolitan area the first phase of this project has of line north to chorrillos south it began commercial operations on july since lima council operates the sistema integrado de transporte urbano urban integrated transport system which comprises buses over avenida arequipa by the end of the metropolitano system counted buses in its central routes and buses in its feeding routes weekday use averages passengers usage increased since by for weekdays for saturdays and for sundays the lima metro has twenty six passenger stations located at an average distance of it begins in the industrial park of villa el salvador south of the city continuing on to av pachac√∫tec in villa mar√≠a del triunfo and then to av los h√©roes in san juan de miraflores afterwards it continues through av tom√°s marsano in surco to reach ov los cabitos to av aviaci√≥n and then cross the river rimac to finish after almost in the east of the capital in san juan de lurigancho the system operates trains each with six wagons each wagon has the capacity to transport people the metro system began operating in december and transported people on average on a daily basis lima has high traffic congestion especially at peak hours million thousand vehicles were in use by the end of the region operates of the cars in the country the ministry of economy and finance mef offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts recreational bike lanes can be found in districts the proyecto especial metropolitano de transporte no motorizado pemtnm estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in the bike lanes ran for they estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of tons of carbon dioxide in san borja district was the first to implement a bike share program called san borja en bici it supplied bicycles and six stations across the district two of them connecting with the metro by december the program had subscribers lima suffers most from air pollution the sedimentary dust has solid particles that settle as dust on different surfaces or float through the air the fine particles are the most dangerous given that they are able to damage human respiratory systems the recommended limit of these particles by the world health organization is tons km2 month in february lima recorded an average of tons km2 the two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are el agustino tons km2 and independencia tons km2 in february the permissible limit of lead in the water supply is milligrams per liter according to the norm itintec in january the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of sedapal was iron lead cadmium and aluminum these values increased and in iron and cadmium with respect to january and a decrease of and in lead and aluminum the values are within the recommended limits the amount of solid waste produced per capita in lima is about per day in each resident produced of solid waste the district municipalities only collect about of the solid waste they generate the rest ends up in informal landfills rivers or the ocean three municipalities recycle or more of their waste in lima of households have access to water supply in their homes in addition of homes connect with sewage systems of homes have grid electric service although most households have water and sewage systems some are available for only a few hours a day the perception of security varies by district for example san isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity while rimac has the highest perception of insecurity according to a survey the five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are san isidro san borja miraflores la molina and jesus maria the districts with the highest perception of insecurity are rimac san juan de miraflores la victoria comas and ate overall of the population in lima above years old has been a crime victim the younger population ages to years old has the highest victimization rate in citizens reported thefts in homes or establishments robbery or attack gang aggression among others in lesser frequency the districts with the highest level of victimization are rimac el agustino villa el salvador san juan de lurigancho and los olivos the safest districts by level of victimization are lurin lurigancho chosica san borja magdalena and surquillo these districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity while the police force is nationally controlled and funded each district in lima has a community policing structure called serenazgo the quantity of serenazgos officials and resources varies by district for example villa maria del triunfo has citizens per official twenty two districts in lima have a ratio above citizens per serenazgo official while districts have ratios below citizens per official including miraflores with and san isidro with the satisfaction with the serenazgos also varies greatly by district the highest satisfaction rates can be found in san isidro miraflores san borja and surco the lowest satisfaction rates can be found in villa maria del triunfo san juan de miraflores rimac and la victoria

galleries libraries sporting events and other cultural institutions including the british museum national gallery natural history museum tate modern british library and west end theatres the london underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world it is an ancient name attested already in the first century ad usually in the latinised form londinium for example handwritten roman tablets recovered in the city originating from ad include the word londinio in london over the years the name has attracted many mythicising explanations the earliest attested appears in geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae written around this had it that the name originated from a supposed king lud who had allegedly taken over the city and named it kaerlud modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources latin usually londinium old english usually lunden and welsh usually llundein with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages it is agreed that the name came into these languages from common brythonic recent work tends to reconstruct the lost celtic form of the name as londonjon or something similar this was adapted into latin as londinium and borrowed into west germanic the ancestor language of english the toponymy of the common brythonic form is much debated a prominent explanation was richard coates s argument that the name derived from pre celtic old european p lowonida meaning river too wide to ford coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the river thames which flows through london from this the settlement gained the celtic form of its name lowonidonjon however most work has accepted a celtic origin for the name and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a celtic derivative of an proto indo european root lend sink cause to sink combined with the celtic suffix injo or onjo used to form place names peter schrijver has specifically suggested on these grounds that the name originally meant place that floods periodically tidally until the name london applied to the city of london but since then it has also referred to the county of london and greater london london is sometimes written informally as ldn in the remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream of vauxhall bridge this bridge either crossed the thames or reached a now lost island in it two of those timbers were radiocarbon dated to between bc and bc in the foundations of a large timber structure dated to between bc and bc were found on the thames s south foreshore downstream of vauxhall bridge the function of the mesolithic structure is not known both structures are on the south bank where the river effra flows into the thames although there is evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans about four years after the invasion of ad this lasted only until around ad when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it burning it to the ground the next heavily planned incarnation of londinium prospered and it superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in at its height in the 2nd century roman london had a population of around with the collapse of roman rule in the early 5th century london ceased to be a capital and the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned although roman civilisation continued in the area of st martin in the fields until around from around an anglo saxon settlement known as lundenwic developed slightly west of the old roman city by about the city had regrown into a major port although there is little evidence of large scale production from the 820s repeated viking assaults brought decline three are recorded those in and succeeded while the last in was rebuffed the vikings established danelaw over much of eastern and northern england its boundary stretched roughly from london to chester it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed by the danish warlord guthrum and the west saxon king alfred the great in the anglo saxon chronicle recorded that alfred refounded london in archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls london then grew slowly until about after which activity increased dramatically by the 11th century london was beyond all comparison the largest town in england westminster abbey rebuilt in the romanesque style by king edward the confessor was one of the grandest churches in europe winchester had previously been the capital of anglo saxon england but from this time on london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war in the view of frank stenton it had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self consciousness appropriate to a national capital after winning the battle of hastings william duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newly completed westminster abbey on christmas day william constructed the tower of london the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the native inhabitants in william ii began the building of westminster hall close by the abbey of the same name the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster in the 12th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto accompanied the royal english court as it moved around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place for most purposes this was westminster although the royal treasury having been moved from winchester came to rest in the tower while the city of westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms its distinct neighbour the city of london remained england s largest city and principal commercial centre and it flourished under its own unique administration the corporation of london in its population was around by it had grown to nearly disaster struck in the form of the black death in the mid 14th century when london lost nearly a third of its population london was the focus of the peasants revolt in london was also a centre of england s jewish population before their expulsion by edward i in violence against jews took place in after it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation in during the second barons war simon de montfort s rebels killed jews while attempting to seize records of debts during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism and much of london property passed from church to private ownership which accelerated trade and business in the city in the hanseatic league set up its main trading base kontor of england in london called the stalhof or steelyard it existed until when the hanseatic cities of l√ºbeck bremen and hamburg sold the property to south eastern railway woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th 15th century london to the nearby shores of the low countries where it was considered indispensable but the reach of english maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north west europe the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean sea normally lay through antwerp and over the alps any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan upon the re opening of the netherlands to english shipping in january there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity the royal exchange was founded mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the east india company were established with trade expanding to the new world london became the principal north sea port with migrants arriving from england and abroad the population rose from an estimated in to about in in the 16th century william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre by the end of the tudor period in london was still very compact there was an assassination attempt on james i in westminster in the gunpowder plot on november in the english civil war the majority of londoners supported the parliamentary cause after an initial advance by the royalists in culminating in the battles of brentford and turnham green london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication the lines were built by up to people and were completed in under two months the fortifications failed their only test when the new model army entered london in and they were levelled by parliament the same year london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century culminating in the great plague of which killed up to people or a fifth of the population the great fire of london broke out in in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by robert hooke as surveyor of london in christopher wren s masterpiece st paul s cathedral was completed during the georgian era new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london in the east the port of london expanded downstream london s development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s in george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged over the next years during the 18th century london was dogged by crime and the bow street runners were established in as a professional police force in total more than offences were punishable by death including petty theft most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available and fleet street became the centre of the british press following the invasion of amsterdam by napoleonic armies many financiers relocated to london especially a large jewish community and the first london international issue was arranged in around the same time the royal navy became the world leading war fleet acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the united kingdom the repeal of the corn laws in was specifically aimed at weakening dutch economic power london then overtook amsterdam as the leading international financial centre in london became home to a series of murders by a man known only as jack the ripper and it has since become one of the world s most famous unsolved mysteries according to samuel johnson london was the world s largest city from to london s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics claiming lives in and in rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world s first local urban rail network the metropolitan board of works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties it was abolished in when the london county council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital london was bombed by the germans during the first world war and during the second world war the blitz and other bombings by the german luftwaffe killed over londoners destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city immediately after the war the summer olympics were held at the original wembley stadium at a time when london was still recovering from the war from the 1940s onwards london became home to a large number of immigrants primarily from commonwealth countries such as jamaica india bangladesh and pakistan making london one of the most diverse cities worldwide in the festival of britain was held on the south bank the great smog of led to the clean air act which ended the pea soup fogs for which london had been notorious primarily starting in the mid 1960s london became a centre for the worldwide youth culture exemplified by the swinging london subculture associated with the king s road chelsea and carnaby street the role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era in london s political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created during the troubles in northern ireland london was subjected to bombing attacks by the provisional ira for two decades starting with the old bailey bombing in racial inequality was highlighted by the brixton riot greater london s population declined steadily in the decades after the second world war from an estimated peak of million in to around million in the 1980s the principal ports for london moved downstream to felixstowe and tilbury with the london docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration including the canary wharf development this was borne out of london s ever increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s the thames barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect london against tidal surges from the north sea the greater london council was abolished in which left london without a central administration until when london wide government was restored with the creation of the greater london authority to celebrate the start of the 21st century the millennium dome london eye and millennium bridge were constructed on july london was awarded the summer olympics making london the first city to stage the olympic games three times on july three london underground trains and a double decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks in london named alongside new york city and hong kong as nylonkong being hailed as the world s three most influential global cities in january greater london s population was estimated to be million the highest level since during the brexit referendum in the uk as a whole decided to leave the european union but a majority of london constituencies voted to remain in the eu the administration of london is formed of two tiers a citywide strategic tier and a local tier citywide administration is coordinated by the greater london authority gla while local administration is carried out by smaller authorities the gla consists of two elected components the mayor of london who has executive powers and the london assembly which scrutinises the mayor s decisions and can accept or reject the mayor s budget proposals each year the headquarters of the gla is city hall southwark the mayor is sadiq khan the first muslim mayor of a major western capital the mayor s statutory planning strategy is published as the london plan which was most recently revised in the local authorities are the councils of the london boroughs and the city of london corporation they are responsible for most local services such as local planning schools social services local roads and refuse collection certain functions such as waste management are provided through joint arrangements in the combined revenue expenditure by london councils and the gla amounted to just over billion billion for the boroughs and billion for the gla the london fire brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for greater london it is run by the london fire and emergency planning authority and is the third largest fire service in the world national health service ambulance services are provided by the london ambulance service las nhs trust the largest free at the point of use emergency ambulance service in the world the london air ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the las where required her majesty s coastguard and the royal national lifeboat institution operate on the river thames which is under the jurisdiction of the port of london authority from teddington lock to the sea london is the seat of the government of the united kingdom many government departments as well as the prime minister s residence at downing street are based close to the palace of westminster particularly along whitehall the british parliament is often referred to as the mother of parliaments although this sobriquet was first applied to england itself and not to westminster by john bright because it has been a model for many other parliamentary systems there are members of parliament mps from london elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national parliament are from the labour party are conservatives and three are liberal democrat the uk government ministerial post of minister for london was created in and currently occupied by jo johnson policing in greater london with the exception of the city of london is provided by the metropolitan police service overseen by the mayor through the mayor s office for policing and crime mopac the city of london has its own police force the city of london police the british transport police are responsible for police services on national rail london underground docklands light railway and tramlink services a fourth police force in london the ministry of defence police do not generally become involved with policing the general public crime rates vary widely by area ranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe today crime figures are made available nationally at local authority and ward level in there were homicides a increase over the metropolitan police have made detailed crime figures broken down by category at borough and ward level available on their website since recorded crime has been rising in london notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen there have been murders from the start of to mid april funding cuts to police in london are likely to have contributed to this though other factors are also involved london also referred to as greater london is one of nine regions of england and the top level subdivision covering most of the city s metropolis the small ancient city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the corporation of london resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs causing london to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes forty per cent of greater london is covered by the london post town within which london forms part of postal addresses the london telephone area code covers a larger area similar in size to greater london although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m25 motorway in places outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt although the built up area extends beyond the boundary in places resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area beyond this is the vast london commuter belt greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london the city is split by the river thames into north and south with an informal central london area in its interior the coordinates of the nominal centre of london traditionally considered to be the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall are about however the geographical centre of london on one definition is in the london borough of lambeth just miles to the northeast of lambeth north tube station within london both the city of london and the city of westminster have city status and both the city of london and the remainder of greater london are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies the area of greater london has incorporated areas that are part of the historic counties of middlesex kent surrey essex and hertfordshire london s status as the capital of england and later the united kingdom has never been granted or confirmed officially by statute or in written form its position was formed through constitutional convention making its status as de facto capital a part of the uk s uncodified constitution the capital of england was moved to london from winchester as the palace of westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation more recently greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london greater london encompasses a total area of an area which had a population of in and a population density of the extended area known as the london metropolitan region or the london metropolitan agglomeration comprises a total area of has a population of and a population density of modern london stands on the thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the south west to the east the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill addington hills and primrose hill historically london grew up at the lowest bridging point on the thames the thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked and many of its london tributaries now flow underground the thames is a tidal river and london is vulnerable to flooding the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow tilting of the british isles up in scotland and northern ireland and down in southern parts of england wales and ireland caused by post glacial rebound in a decade of work began on the construction of the thames barrier across the thames at woolwich to deal with this threat while the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed london has a temperate oceanic climate k√∂ppen cfb receiving less precipitation in a year than rome bordeaux lisbon naples sydney and new york city temperature extremes for all sites in the london area range from at kew during august down to at northolt during january summers are generally warm sometimes hot london s average july high is c f on average london will see days above each year and days above every year during the european heat wave there were consecutive days above and consecutive days where temperatures reached leading to hundreds of heat related deaths winters are generally cool cloudy and damp with little temperature variation snow is rare spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant as a large city london has a considerable urban heat island effect making the centre of london at times warmer than the suburbs and outskirts the effect of this can be seen below when comparing london heathrow west of london with the london weather centre in the city centre london s vast urban area is often described using a set of district names such as bloomsbury mayfair wembley and whitechapel these are either informal designations reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs such names have remained in use through tradition each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character but without official boundaries since greater london has been divided into london boroughs in addition to the ancient city of london the city of london is the main financial district and canary wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the docklands to the east the west end is london s main entertainment and shopping district attracting tourists west london includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds the average price for properties in kensington and chelsea is over million with a similarly high outlay in most of central london the east end is the area closest to the original port of london known for its high immigrant population as well as for being one of the poorest areas in london the surrounding east london area saw much of london s early industrial development now brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the thames gateway including the london riverside and lower lea valley which was developed into the olympic park for the olympics and paralympics london s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style partly because of their varying ages many grand houses and public buildings such as the national gallery are constructed from portland stone some areas of the city particularly those just west of the centre are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings few structures in central london pre date the great fire of these being a few trace roman remains the tower of london and a few scattered tudor survivors in the city further out is for example the tudor period hampton court palace england s oldest surviving tudor palace built by cardinal thomas wolsey 17th century churches by wren neoclassical financial institutions such as the royal exchange and the bank of england to the early 20th century old bailey and the 1960s barbican estate form part of the varied architectural heritage the disused but soon to be rejuvenated battersea power station by the river in the south west is a local landmark while some railway termini are excellent examples of victorian architecture most notably st pancras and paddington the density of london varies with high employment density in the central area high residential densities in inner london and lower densities in outer london the monument in the city of london provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the great fire of london which originated nearby marble arch and wellington arch at the north and south ends of park lane respectively have royal connections as do the albert memorial and royal albert hall in kensington nelson s column is a nationally recognised monument in trafalgar square one of the focal points of central london older buildings are mainly brick built most commonly the yellow london stock brick or a warm orange red variety often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings in the dense areas most of the concentration is via medium and high rise buildings london s skyscrapers such as st mary axe tower the broadgate tower and one canada square are mostly in the two financial districts the city of london and canary wharf high rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of st paul s cathedral and other historic buildings nevertheless there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central london see tall buildings in london including the storey shard london bridge the tallest building in the european union other notable modern buildings include city hall in southwark with its distinctive oval shape and the british library in somers town kings cross what was formerly the millennium dome by the thames to the east of canary wharf is now an entertainment venue called the o2 arena the london natural history society suggest that london is one of the world s greenest cities with more than percent green space or open water they indicate that species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal thames supports species of fish they also state that over species of bird nest in central london and that their members have recorded species of butterfly moths and more than kinds of spider around london london s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds london has sites of special scientific interest sssis two national nature reserves and local nature reserves amphibians are common in the capital including smooth newts living by the tate modern and common frogs common toads palmate newts and great crested newts on the other hand native reptiles such as slowworms common lizards grass snakes and adders are mostly only seen in outer london among other inhabitants of london are red foxes so that there are now foxes for every square mile square kilometres of london these urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people s backyards foxes have even sneaked into the houses of parliament where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet another broke into the grounds of buckingham palace reportedly killing some of queen elizabethii s prized pink flamingos generally however foxes and city folk appear to get along a survey in by the london based mammal society found that percent of respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around this sample cannot be taken to represent londoners as a whole other mammals found in greater london are hedgehogs rats mice rabbit shrew vole and squirrels in wilder areas of outer london such as epping forest a wide variety of mammals are found including hare badger field bank and water vole wood mouse yellow necked mouse mole shrew and weasel in addition to fox squirrel and hedgehog a dead otter was found at the highway in wapping about a mile from the tower bridge which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city ten of england s eighteen species of bats have been recorded in epping forest soprano nathusius and common pipistrelles noctule serotine barbastelle daubenton s brown long eared natterer s and leisler s among the strange sights seen in london have been a whale in the thames while the bbc two programme natural world unnatural history of london shows pigeons using the london underground to get around the city a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside billingsgate fish market and foxes that will sit if given sausages herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of richmond and bushy park a cull takes place each november and february to ensure numbers can be sustained epping forest is also known for its fallow deer which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the forest a rare population of melanistic black fallow deer is also maintained at the deer sanctuary near theydon bois muntjac deer which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century are also found in the forest while londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of london s green spaces the census recorded that people or of london s population are foreign born making london the city with the second largest immigrant population behind new york city in terms of absolute numbers about of children born in london in had at least one parent who was born abroad the table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of london residents note that some of the german born population

and early 20th centuries and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world its population peaked at in immediately before the outbreak of the second world war but had declined to at the census however the population then grew by just over a million between the and censuses to reach in the latter enumeration however london s continuous urban

 bangkok bangkok is the capital and most populous city of thailand it is known in thai as krung thep maha nakhon or simply krung thep the city occupies in the chao phraya river delta in central thailand and has a population of over eight million or percent of the country s population over fourteen million people percent lived within the surrounding bangkok metropolitan region at the census making bangkok the nation s primate city significantly dwarfing thailand s other urban centres in terms of importance bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the ayutthaya kingdom in the 15th century which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities thonburi in and rattanakosin in bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of siam later renamed thailand during the late 19th century as the country faced pressures from the west the city was at the centre of thailand s political struggles throughout the 20th century as the country abolished absolute monarchy adopted constitutional rule and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings the city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on thailand s politics economy education media and modern society the asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in bangkok the city is now a regional force in finance and business it is an international hub for transport and health care and has emerged as a centre for the arts fashion and entertainment the city is known for its vibrant street life and cultural landmarks as well as its notorious red light districts the historic grand palace and buddhist temples including wat arun and wat pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of khaosan road and patpong bangkok s rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure an inadequate road network despite an extensive expressway network together with substantial private car usage have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s the city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem five rapid transit lines are now in operation with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the bangkok metropolitan administration the history of bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century when it was a village on the west bank of the chao phraya river under the rule of ayutthaya because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river the town gradually increased in importance bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river and became the site of a siege in in which the french were expelled from siam after the fall of ayutthaya to the burmese empire in the newly declared king taksin established his capital at the town which became the base of the thonburi kingdom in king phutthayotfa chulalok rama i succeeded taksin moved the capital to the eastern bank s rattanakosin island thus founding the rattanakosin kingdom the city pillar was erected on april which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city bangkok s economy gradually expanded through busy international trade first with china then with western merchants returning in the early to mid 19th century as the capital bangkok was the centre of siam s modernization as it faced pressure from western powers in the late 19th century the reigns of kings mongkut rama iv and chulalongkorn rama v saw the introduction of the steam engine printing press rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city as well as formal education and healthcare bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country abolished absolute monarchy in it was subject to japanese occupation and allied bombing during world war ii but rapidly grew in the post war period as a result of united states developmental aid and government sponsored investment bangkok s role as an american military r r destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and unprecedented migration from rural areas into bangkok its population surged from million to million in the 1960s following the united states withdrawal from vietnam in japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment and the expansion of export oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in bangkok rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s until it was stalled by the asian financial crisis by then many public and social issues had emerged among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city s notorious traffic jams bangkok s role as the nation s political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests from the student uprisings in and anti military demonstrations in and successive anti government demonstrations by opposing groups from onwards administration of the city was first formalized by king chulalongkorn in with the establishment of monthon krung thep phra maha nakhon as a national subdivision in the monthon was split into several provinces the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed the city in its current form was created in with the formation of the bangkok metropolitan administration bma following the merger of phra nakhon province on the eastern bank of the chao phraya and thonburi province on the west during the previous year the origin of the name bangkok pronounced in thai as is unclear bang is a thai word meaning a village on a stream and the name might have been derived from bang ko ko meaning island stemming from the city s watery landscape another theory suggests that it

letters thai school children are taught the full name although few can explain its meaning as many of the words are archaic and known to few most thais who recall the full name do so because of its

capital bangkok city proper covers an area of ranking 69th among the other provinces of thailand of this about form the built up urban area it is ranked 73rd in the world in terms of land area by city mayors the city s urban sprawl reaches into parts of the six other provinces it borders namely in clockwise order from northwest nonthaburi pathum thani chachoengsao samut prakan samut sakhon and nakhon pathom with the exception of chachoengsao these provinces together with bangkok form the greater bangkok metropolitan region bangkok is in the chao phraya river delta in thailand s central plains the river meanders through the city in a southward direction emptying into the gulf of thailand approximately south of the city centre the area is flat and low lying with an average elevation of above sea level most of the area was originally swampland which was gradually drained and irrigated for agriculture via the construction of canals khlong which took place throughout the 16th to 19th centuries the course of the river as it flows through bangkok has been modified by the construction of several shortcut canals this intricate waterway network served as the primary mode of transport up until the late 19th century when modern roads began to be built up until then most people lived near or on the water leading the city to be known during the 19th century as the venice of the east many of these canals have since been filled in or paved over but others still criss cross the city serving as major drainage channels and transport routes most canals are now badly polluted although the bma has committed to the treatment and cleaning up of several canals the geology of the bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft marine clay known as bangkok clay averaging in thickness which overlies an aquifer system consisting of eight known units this feature has contributed to the effects of subsidence caused by extensive ground water pumping first recognized in the 1970s subsidence soon became a critical issue reaching a rate of per year in ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of per year and parts of the city are now below sea level there are fears that the city may be submerged by subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk as bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and inadequate drainage infrastructure resulting from rapid urbanization the city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels but parts of bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly affected by flooding heavy downpours resulting in urban runoff overwhelming drainage systems and runoff discharge from upstream areas are major triggering factors severe flooding affecting much of the city occurred recently in and in the latter most of bangkok s northern eastern and western districts became inundated in some places for over two months coastal erosion is also an issue in the gulf coastal area a small length of which lies within bangkok s bang khun thian district global warming poses further serious risks and a study by the oecd has estimated that million people in bangkok may be exposed to coastal flooding by the seventh highest among the world s port cities there are no mountains in bangkok the closest mountain range being the khao khiao massif located about southeast of the city phu khao thong the only hill in the metropolitan area originated in a very large chedi that king rama iii decided to build at wat saket the chedi collapsed during construction because the soft soil of bangkok could not support the weight over the next few decades the abandoned mud and brick structure acquired the shape of a natural hill and became overgrown with weeds the locals called it phu khao ‡∏† ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤ as if it were a natural feature in the 1940s surrounding concrete walls were added to stop the hill from eroding like most of thailand bangkok has a tropical savanna climate under the k√∂ppen climate classification and is under the influence of the south asian monsoon system it experiences three seasons hot rainy and cool although temperatures are fairly hot year round ranging from an average low of in december to an average high of in april the rainy season begins with the arrival of the southwest monsoon around mid may september is the wettest month with an average rainfall of the rainy season lasts until october when the dry and cool northeast monsoon takes

bangkok s fifty districts serve as administrative subdivisions under the authority of the bma thirty five of these districts lie to the east of the chao phraya while fifteen are on the western bank known as the thonburi side of the city the fifty districts arranged by district code are the bma uses several schemes to organize the districts into groups for administrative and general planning purposes the scheme adopted in used twelve characteristic groups bangkok s district areas often do not accurately represent the functional divisions of its neighbourhoods or actual land uses although urban planning policies date back to the commission of the litchfield plan in which set out strategies for land use transportation and general infrastructure improvements actual zoning regulations were not fully implemented until as a result the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion both horizontally as ribbon developments extended along newly built roads and vertically with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in several commercial areas the city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces the highly populated and growing cities of nonthaburi pak kret rangsit and samut prakan are effectively now suburbs of bangkok nevertheless large agricultural areas remain within the city proper in its eastern and western fringes land use in the city consists of percent residential use percent agriculture and percent used for commerce industry and by the government the bma s city planning department is responsible for planning and shaping further development it has published master plan updates in and and a third revision is undergoing public hearings in bangkok s historic centre remains the rattanakosin island in phra nakhon district it is the site of the grand palace and the

serving over bus lines as well as an elevated train station from the monument phahonyothin and ratchawithi din daeng roads respectively run northward and eastward linking to major residential areas most high density development is located within the area encircled by the ratchadaphisek inner ring road ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets and office buildings also concentrate around ratchayothin intersection in chatuchak district to the north farther from the city centre most areas are primarily mid or low density residential the thonburi side of the city is less developed with fewer high rises with the exception of a few secondary urban centres thonburi as well as the outlying eastern districts consist mostly of residential and rural areas while most of bangkok s streets are fronted by vernacular shophouses the largely unrestricted building frenzy of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban jungle of skyscrapers and high rises exhibiting contrasting and clashing styles there are skyscrapers over tall in the city bangkok was ranked as the world s 8th tallest city in on the other hand as a result of economic disparity many slums have emerged in the city in there were over million people living in about slum settlements a large number of slums are concentrated near the bangkok port in khlong toei district bangkok has several parks although these amount to a per capita total park area of only in the city proper total green space for the entire city is moderate at per person however in the more densely built up areas of the city these numbers are as low as per person more recent numbers claim that there is only m of green space per person compared to an average of m in other cities across asia in europe london has m of green space per head bangkokians thus have times less green space than is standard in the region s urban areas green belt areas include about of rice paddies and orchards in the eastern and western edges of the city proper although their primary purpose is to serve as flood detention basins rather than to limit urban expansion bang kachao a conservation area in an oxbow of the chao phraya lies just across the southern riverbank districts in samut prakan province a master development plan has been proposed to increase total park area to per person bangkok s largest parks include the centrally

centre since its establishment as capital city in bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries british diplomat john crawfurd visiting in estimated its population at no more than as a result of western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within siam and overseas bangkok s population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late 19th century this growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s following the discovery of antibiotics although family planning and birth control was introduced in the 1960s the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated only in the 1990s have bangkok s population growth rates decreased following the national rate

of the city s population is buddhist other religions include islam christianity hinduism sikhism and confucianism apart from yaowarat bangkok also has several other distinct ethnic neighbourhoods the indian community is centred in phahurat where the gurdwara siri guru singh sabha founded in is located ban khrua on saen saep canal is home to descendants of the cham who settled in the late 18th century although the portuguese who settled during the thonburi period have ceased to exist as a distinct community their past is reflected in santa cruz church on the west bank of the river likewise the assumption cathedral on charoen krung road is among many european style buildings in the old farang quarter where european diplomats and merchants lived during the late 19th to early 20th centuries nearby the haroon mosque is the centre of a muslim community newer expatriate communities exist along sukhumvit road including the japanese community near soi phrom phong and soi thong lo

encountered by foreign tourists include scams overcharging and dual pricing in a survey of tourists visiting thailand percent reported encountering a scam the most common of which was the gem scam in which tourists are tricked into buying overpriced jewellery the culture of bangkok reflects its position as thailand s centre of wealth and modernisation the city has long been the portal of entry of western concepts and material goods which have been adopted and blended with thai values to various degrees by its residents this is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class conspicuous consumption serves as a display of economic and social status and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous this has been accompanied by a degree of secularism as religion s role in everyday life has rather diminished although such trends have spread to other urban centres and to a degree the countryside bangkok remains at the forefront of social change a distinct feature of bangkok is the ubiquity of street vendors selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories it has been estimated that the city may have over hawkers while the bma has authorised the practice in sites the majority of activity in another sites takes place illegally although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic many of the city s residents depend on these vendors for their meals and the bma s efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful in however the bma with support from the national council for peace and order thailand s ruling military junta began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space many famous market neighbourhoods were affected including khlong thom saphan lek and the flower market at pak khlong talat nearly vendors were evicted from public areas in while some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights

broadcast television all six national terrestrial channels channels and modernine nbt and thai pbs have headquarters and main studios in the capital with the exception of local news segments broadcast by the nbt all programming is done in bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces however this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television which has many local providers there are numerous cable and satellite channels based in bangkok truevisions is the major subscription television provider in bangkok and thailand and it also carries international programming bangkok was home to of thailand s fm radio stations and of its am stations in broadcast media reform stipulated by the constitution has been progressing slowly although many community radio stations have emerged

studios bangkok has dozens of cinemas and multiplexes and the city hosts two major film festivals annually the bangkok international film festival and the world film festival of bangkok traditional

the city especially by the working class football and other modern sports are now more of the norm western sports were introduced during the reign of king chulalongkorn and were originally only available to the privileged such status is still associated with certain sports golf is popular among the upwardly mobile and while thailand s more famous clubs are in the countryside there are several courses in bangkok itself horse riding takes place in a couple of exclusive clubs in the city horse racing is very popular in bangkok and betting on horses is legal there are two racecourses in bangkok royal bangkok sports club and royal turf club of thailand there are many public sporting facilities located throughout bangkok the two main centres are the national stadium complex which dates to and the newer hua mak sports complex which was built for the asian games bangkok had also hosted the games in and the most of any city the city was the host of the inaugural southeast asian games in the summer universiade and the fifa futsal world cup although bangkok s canals historically served as a major mode of transport they have long since been surpassed in importance by land traffic charoen krung road the first to be built by western techniques was completed in since then the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city a complex elevated expressway network helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre but bangkok s rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s although rail transport was introduced in and electric trams served the city from to it was only in that bangkok s first rapid transit system began operation older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and boat services which still operate on the chao phraya and two canals taxis appear in the form of cars motorcycles and tuk tuk auto rickshaws bangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the national highway and rail networks as well as by domestic flights to and from the city s two international airports its centuries old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through khlong toei port the bma is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its public works department and traffic and transportation department however many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems and much of transport related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government road based transport is the primary mode of travel in bangkok due to the city s organic development its streets do not follow an organized grid structure forty eight major roads link the different areas of the city branching into smaller streets and lanes soi which serve local neighbourhoods eleven bridges over the chao phraya link the two sides of the city while several expressway and motorway routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces bangkok s rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand which have since continued in there were in use vehicles in bangkok of which percent were private cars and percent were motorcycles these increases in the face of limited carrying capacity caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s the extent of the problem is such that the thai traffic police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time while bangkok s limited road surface area percent compared to percent in most western cities is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams other factors including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level inadequate public transport systems and lack of transportation demand management also play a role efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems the city s overall traffic conditions however remain poor traffic has been the main source of air pollution in bangkok which reached serious levels in the 1990s but efforts to improve air quality by improving fuel quality and enforcing emission standards among others had visibly ameliorated the problem by the 2000s atmospheric particulate matter levels dropped from micrograms per cubic metre in to in however increasing vehicle numbers and a lack of continued pollution control efforts threatens a reversal of the past success in january february weather conditions caused bouts of haze to cover the city with particulate matter under micrometres pm rising to unhealthy levels for several days on end although the bma has created thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling cycling is still largely impractical especially in the city centre most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians poor surface maintenance encroachment by hawkers and street vendors and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in bangkok bangkok has an extensive bus network providing local transit services within the greater bangkok area the bangkok mass transit authority bmta operates a monopoly on bus services with substantial concessions granted to private operators buses minibus vans and song thaeo operate on a total of routes throughout the region a separate bus rapid transit system owned by the bma has been in operation since known simply as the brt the system currently consists of a single line running from the business district at sathon to ratchaphruek on the western side of the city the transport co ltd is the bmta s long distance counterpart with services to all provinces operating out of bangkok taxis are ubiquitous in bangkok and are a popular form of transport there are cars motorcycles and tuk tuk motorized tricycles cumulatively registered for use as taxis meters have been required for car taxis since while tuk tuk fares are usually negotiated motorcycle taxis operate from regulated ranks with either fixed or negotiable fares and are usually employed for relatively short journeys despite their popularity taxis have gained a bad reputation for often refusing passengers when the requested route is not to the driver s convenience motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs since registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks and drivers now wear distinctive numbered vests designating their district of registration and where they are allowed to accept passengers bangkok is the location of hua lamphong railway station the main terminus of the national rail network operated by the state railway of thailand srt in addition to long distance services the srt also operates a few daily commuter trains running from and to the outskirts of the city during the rush hour bangkok is currently served by three rapid transit systems the bts skytrain the underground mrt and the elevated airport rail link although proposals for the development of rapid transit in bangkok had been made since it was only in that the bts finally began operation the bts consists of two lines sukhumvit and silom with thirty four stations along the mrt opened for use in july and currently consists of two lines the blue line and purple line the airport rail link opened in august connects the city centre to suvarnabhumi airport to the east its eight stations span a distance of although initial passenger numbers were low and their service area remains limited to the inner city these systems have become indispensable to many commuters the bts reported an average of daily trips in while the mrt had passenger trips per day construction work is ongoing to extend bts and mrt as well as several additional transit lines including the light red grade separated commuter rail line the entire mass rapid transit master plan in bangkok metropolitan region consists of eight main lines and four feeder lines totalling to be completed by in addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines there have been proposals for several monorail systems although much diminished from its past prominence water based transport still plays an important role in bangkok and the immediate upstream and downstream provinces several water buses serve commuters daily the chao phraya express boat serves thirty four stops along the river carrying an average of passengers per day in while the smaller khlong saen saep boat service

mentioned it as tyroan herbert stated that the city had about houses in the early 18th century karim khan of the zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office to be built in tehran possibly to declare the city his capital but he later moved his government to shiraz eventually qajar king agha mohammad khan chose tehran as the capital of iran in agha mohammad khan s choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control of both northern and southern iran he was aware of the loyalties of the inhabitants of former capitals isfahan and shiraz to the safavid and zand dynasties respectively and was wary of the power of the local notables in these cities thus he probably viewed tehran s lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing because it minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and by the general public moreover he had to remain within close reach of azerbaijan and iran s integral northern and southern caucasian territories at that time not yet irrevocably lost per the treaties of golestan and turkmenchay to the neighboring russian empire which would follow in the course of the 19th century after years of qajar rule the city still barely had more than inhabitants up until the 1870s tehran consisted of a walled citadel a roofed bazaar and the three main neighborhoods of udlajan chale meydan and sangelaj where the majority resided the first development plan of tehran in emphasized the traditional spatial structure architecture however found an eclectic expression to reflect the new lifestyle the second major planning exercise in tehran took place under the supervision of dar ol fonun the plan of tehran included new city walls in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of square kilometers which mimicked the renaissance cities of europe the growing social awareness of civil rights resulted in the constitutional revolution and the first constitution of iran in on june the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the baladie municipal law providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city the members qualifications the election process and the requirements to be entitled to vote the then qajar monarch mohammad ali shah abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament with the help of the russian controlled cossack brigade on june that followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of ali qoli khan sardar asad ii and mohammad vali khan sepahsalar e tonekaboni on july as a result the monarch was exiled and replaced with his son ahmad and the parliament was re established after world war i the constituent assembly elected reza shah of the pahlavi dynasty as the new monarch who immediately suspended the baladie law of replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches of governance and planning from the 1920s to the 1930s under the rule of reza shah the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch that followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings including parts of the golestan palace tekye dowlat and tupkhane square which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical iranian architecture particularly the building of the national bank the police headquarters the telegraph office and the military academy the changes in urban fabric started with the street widening act of which served as a framework for changes in all other cities the grand bazaar was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be replaced with wide straight avenues as a result the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts located on major public spaces such as the bazaar as an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city the old citadel and city walls were demolished in replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric the new city map of tehran in was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks during world war ii soviet and british troops entered the city in tehran was the site of the tehran conference attended by u s president franklin d roosevelt soviet premier joseph stalin and british prime minister winston churchill the establishment of the planning organization of iran in resulted in the first

named the white revolution tehran s chaotic growth was further accentuated throughout the 1960s and 1970s tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of mohammad reza shah modern buildings altered

the spaniards as early as thereafter a considerable amount of trade began to flow between algiers and spain however algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the moors from spain many of whom sought asylum in the city in following their occupation of oran and other towns on the coast of africa the spaniards fortified the islet of pe√±on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity in the amir of algiers selim b teumi invited the corsair brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa to expel the spaniards aruj came to algiers ordered the

algerians under their pasha hassan formally part of the ottoman empire but essentially free from ottoman control starting in the 16th century algiers turned to piracy and ransoming due to its location on the periphery of both the ottoman and european economic spheres and depending for its existence on a mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by european shipping backed by european navies piracy became the primary economic activity repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far

inhabitants and its military defenses with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by spain so as to end the piracy a significant number of renegades lived in algiers at the time christians

day algiers became the capital of french algeria many europeans settled in algiers and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city s population during the 1930s the architect le corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city le corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of algiers describing the european district as nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature the whole a sullied blot he also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the european and african residents of the city describing a situation in which the civilised live like rats in holes whereas the barbarians live in solitude in well being however these plans were ultimately ignored by the french administration during world war ii algiers was the first city to be seized from the germans by the allies during operation torch in after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands estimates range between and died mostly algerians

demonstrations of all descriptions until in a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the islamic salvation front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities in the

somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade plans for moving the nation s capital city from rio de janeiro to the centre of brazil had been occasionally discussed and when juscelino kubitschek was elected president in it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric kubitschek managed to have bras√≠lia and a new federal district built at great cost by on april of that year the capital of brazil was officially moved to bras√≠lia the territory of the former federal district became its own state guanabara after the bay that borders it to the east encompassing just the city of rio de janeiro after the coup d √©tat that installed a military dictatorship the city state was the only state left in brazil to oppose the military then in a presidential decree known as the fusion removed the city s federative status and merged it with the state of rio de janeiro with the city

the costa verde and the cabo frio close to the tropic of capricorn where the shoreline is oriented east west facing largely south the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast guanabara bay ba√≠a de guanabara and its entrance is marked by a point of land called sugar loaf p√£o de a√ß√∫car a calling card of the city the centre centro the core of rio lies on the plains of the western shore of guanabara bay the greater portion of the city commonly referred to as the north zone zona norte extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains the south zone zona sul of the city reaching the beaches fringing the open sea is cut off from the centre and from the north zone by coastal mountains these mountains and hills are offshoots of the serra do mar to the northwest the ancient gneiss granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the brazilian highlands the large west zone zona oeste long cut off by the mountainous terrain had been made more easily accessible to those on the south zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century the population of the city of rio de janeiro occupying an area of is about the population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at million residents of the city are known as cariocas the official song of rio is cidade maravilhosa by

state park which houses the highest point of rio de janeiro the peak of pedra branca the quinta da boa vista complex the botanical garden rio s zoo parque lage and the passeio p√∫blico the first public park in the americas in addition the flamengo park is the largest landfill in the city extending from the center to the south zone and containing museums and monuments in addition to much vegetation due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution the guanabara bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage oils and heavy metals although its waters renew when they reach the sea the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it the levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the world health organization in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation the waters of sepetiba bay are slowly following the path traced by guanabara bay with sewage generated by a population of the order of million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers with regard to industrial pollution highly toxic wastes with high concentrations of heavy metals mainly zinc and cadmium have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of santa cruz itagua√≠ and nova igua√ßu constructed under the supervision of state policies the marapendi lagoon and the rodrigo de freitas lagoon have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by the clandestine discharge of sewage and the consequent proliferation of algae diminish the oxygenation of the waters causing fish mortality there are on the other hand signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a public private partnership established in to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing the decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments however during the olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage rio has a tropical savanna climate that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate am according to the k√∂ppen climate classification and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between december and march the city experiences hot humid summers and mild wet winters in inland areas of the city temperatures above are common during the summer though rarely for long periods while maximum temperatures above can occur on a monthly basis along the coast the breeze blowing onshore and offshore moderates the temperature because of its geographic situation the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from antarctica especially during autumn and winter causing frequent weather changes in summer there can be strong rains which have on some occasions provoked catastrophic floods and landslides the mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the atlantic it is the portuguese word for flemish and it was given to the nearby beach praia do flamengo beach of the flemish because it was the place where the dutch sailor olivier van noort tried to invade the city in at that time the dutchmen were called flemish by the portuguese the city reputedly has had rare frosts in the past but this has never been decisively confirmed some areas within rio de janeiro state occasionally have falls of snow grains and ice pellets popularly called or hail although it is in fact melted and refrozen snow falling in the form of hail rather than just icy snow these phenomena are definitely not rare or limited to a few regions having already happened in the metropolitan area including western suburbs of the city itself several times in the 21st century drought is very rare albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city s strongly seasonal tropical climate the brazilian drought of most severe in the southeast region and the worst in decades affected the entire metropolitan region s water supply a diversion from the para√≠ba do sul river to the guandu river is a major source for the state s most populous mesoregion there were plans to divert the para√≠ba do sul to the sistema cantareira cantareira system during the water crisis of in order to help the critically drought stricken greater s√£o paulo area however availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative roughly in the same suburbs nova igua√ßu and surrounding areas including parts of campo grande and bangu that correspond to the location of the march february march and january pseudo hail granizo falls there was a tornado like phenomenon in january for the first time in the region s recorded history causing structural damage and long lasting blackouts but no fatalities the world meteorological organization has advised that brazil especially its southeastern region must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future since events such as the catastrophic january rio de janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon in early may winds registering above caused blackouts in neighborhoods of the city and three surrounding municipalities and killed one person rio saw similarly high winds about in january the average annual minimum temperature is the average annual maximum temperature is and the average annual temperature is the average yearly precipitation is temperature also varies according to elevation distance from the coast and type of vegetation or land use winter cold fronts and dawn morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures cold fronts the intertropical convergence zone in the form of winds from the amazon forest the strongest sea borne winds often from an extratropical cyclone and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms thus the monsoon like climate has dry and mild winters and springs and very wet and warm summers and autumns as a result temperatures over that may happen about year round but are much more common during the summer often mean the actual temperature feeling is over when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high rio de janeiro is second only to cuiab√° as the hottest brazilian state capital outside northern and northeastern brazil temperatures below occur yearly while those lower than happen less often the phrase fazer frio making cold i e the weather is getting cold usually refers to temperatures going below which is possible year round

densely populated conurbation the santiago metropolitan region whose total population is million the city is entirely located in the country s central valley most of the city lies between and above mean sea level founded in by the spanish conqueror pedro de valdivia santiago has been the capital city of chile since colonial times the city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side streets dotted by art deco neo gothic and other styles santiago s cityscape is shaped by several stand alone hills and the fast flowing mapocho river lined by parks such as parque forestal the andes mountains can be seen from most points in the city these mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem particularly during winter the city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and santiago is within an hour of both the mountains and the pacific ocean santiago is the cultural political and financial center of chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations the chilean executive and judiciary are located in santiago but congress meets mostly in nearby valpara√≠so santiago is named after the biblical figure st james santiago will host the pan american games in chile there are several entities which bear the name of santiago that are often confused the commune of santiago sometimes referred to as downtown or central santiago santiago centro is an administrative division that comprises roughly the area occupied by the city during its colonial period the commune administered by the municipality of santiago and headed by a mayor is part of the santiago province headed by a provincial governor which is in itself a subdivision of the santiago metropolitan region headed by an intendant despite these classifications when the term santiago is used without another descriptor it usually refers to what is also known as greater santiago gran santiago a territorial extension defined by its urban continuity that includes the commune of santiago in addition to other communes which together comprise the majority of the santiago province and some areas of neighboring provinces see political divisions the city and region s demonym is santiaguinos male and santiaguinas female according to certain archaeological investigations it is believed that the first human groups reached the santiago basin in the 10th millennium bc the groups were mainly nomadic hunter gatherers who traveled from the coast to the interior in search of guanacos during the time of the andean snowmelt about the year the first sedentary inhabitants began to settle due to the formation of agricultural communities along the mapocho river mainly maize potatoes and beans and the domestication of camelids in the area the villages established in the areas belonging to picunches groups name given by chileans or promaucaes name given by incas were subject to the inca empire throughout the late fifteenth century and into the early sixteenth century the incas settled in the valley of mitimaes the main installation settled in the center of the present city with strengths as huaca de chena and the sanctuary of el plomo hill the area would have served as a basis for the failed inca expeditions southward road junction as the inca trail having been sent by francisco pizarro from peru and having made the long journey from cuzco extremadura conquistador pedro de valdivia reached the valley of the mapocho on december the hosts of valdivia camped by the river in the slopes of the tupahue hill and slowly began to interact with the picunches natives who inhabited the area valdivia later summoned the chiefs of the area to a parliament where he explained his intention to found a city on behalf of the king carlos i of spain which would be the capital of his governorship of nueva extremadura the natives accepted and even recommended the foundation of the town on a small island between two branches of the river next to a small hill called huel√©n on february valdivia officially founded the city of santiago del nuevo extremo santiago of new extremadura in honor of st james patron saint of spain near the huel√©n renamed by the conqueror as st lucia the name santiago is the local galician evolution of vulgar latin sanctu iacobu saint james following colonial rule valdivia entrusted the layout of the new town to master builder pedro de gamboa who would design the city grid layout in the center of the city gamboa designed a plaza mayor around which various plots for the cathedral and the governor s house were selected in total eight blocks from north to south and ten from east to west were built each solar quarter block was given to the settlers who built houses of mud and straw valdivia left months later to the south with his troops beginning the war of arauco santiago was left unprotected the indigenous hosts of michimalonco used this to their advantage and attacked the fledgling city on september the city was destroyed by the natives but the spanish garrison managed to defend the fort the resistance was led by in√©s de su√°rez a mistress to valdivia when she realized they were being overrun she ordered the execution of all native prisoners and proceeded to put their heads on pikes and also threw a few heads to the natives in face of this barbaric act the natives dispersed in terror the city would be slowly rebuilt giving prominence to the newly founded concepci√≥n where the royal audiencia of chile was then founded in however the constant danger faced by concepci√≥n due partly to its proximity to the war of arauco and also to a succession of devastating earthquakes would not allow the definitive establishment of the royal court in santiago until this establishment reaffirmed the city s role as capital although early santiago appeared to be in imminent danger of permanent destruction threatened by indigenous attacks earthquakes and a series of floods the city began to grow rapidly of the blocks designed by gamboa in forty were occupied and in the first major buildings in the city began to rise the start of construction highlighted with the placing of the foundation stone of the first cathedral in and the building of the church of san francisco in both of these constructions consisted of mainly adobe and stone in addition to construction of important buildings the city began to develop as nearby lands welcomed tens of thousands of livestock a series of disasters impeded the development of the city during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries an earthquake a smallpox epidemic in and the mapocho river floods and finally the earthquake of may which killed over people and affected more than five thousand others however these disasters would not stop the growth of the capital of the captaincy general of chile at a time when all the power of the country was centered on the plaza de armas santiaguina in the corregidor luis manuel de za√±artu launched one of the most important architectural works of the entire colonial period calicanto bridge effectively connecting the city to la chimba on the north side of the river and began the construction of embankments to prevent overflows of the mapocho river although its builders were able to complete the bridge the piers were constantly being damaged by the river in governor agust√≠n de j√°uregui hired the italian architect joaqu√≠n toesca who would design among other important works the fa√ßade of the cathedral the palacio de la moneda the canal san carlos and the final construction of the embankments during the government of ambrosio o higgins these important works were opened permanently in the o higgins government also oversaw the opening of the road to valpara√≠so in which connected the capital with the country s main port september was proclaimed the first government junta in santiago beginning the process of establishing the independence of chile the city which became the capital of the new nation was threatened by various events especially the nearby military actions although some institutions such as the national institute and the national library were installed in the patria vieja they were closed after the patriot defeat at the battle of rancagua in the royal government lasted until when the army of the andes secured victory in battle of chacabuco reinstating the patriot government in santiago independence however was not assured the spanish army gained new victories in and headed for santiago but their march was definitively halted on the plains of the maipo river during the battle of maip√∫ on april with the end of the war bernardo o higgins was accepted as supreme director and like his father began a number of important works for the city during the call patria nueva closed institutions reopened the general cemetery opened work on the canal san carlos was completed and in the south arm of the mapocho river known as la ca√±ada the drying riverbed used for sometime as a landfill was turned into an avenue now known as the alameda de las delicias two new earthquakes hit the city one on november and another on february these two events however did not prevent the city s rapid continued growth in the city reported inhabitants while in the population reached in the census reported inhabitants this significant increase was the result of suburban growth to the south and west of the capital and in part to la chimba a vibrant district growing from the division of old properties that existed in the area this new peripheral development led to the end of the traditional checkerboard structure that previously governed the city center during the years of the republican era institutions such as the university of chile universidad de chile the normal school of preceptors the school of arts and crafts and the quinta normal which included the museum of fine arts now museum of science and technology and the national museum of natural history were founded created primarily for educational use they also became examples of public planning during that period in the first telegraph system connecting the capital with the port of valpara√≠so was inaugurated a new momentum in the urban development of the capital took place during the so called liberal republic and the administration of mayor benjam√≠n vicu√±a mackenna among the main works during this period are the remodeling of the cerro santa luc√≠a which despite its central location had been in a state of poor repair in an effort to transform santiago vicu√±a mackenna began construction of the camino de cintura a road surrounding the entire city a new redevelopment of the alameda avenue turned it into the main road of the city also during this time and with the work of european landscapers in o higgins park came into existence the park open to the public became a landmark in santiago due to its large gardens lakes and carriage trails other important buildings were opened during this era such as the teatro municipal opera house and the club h√≠pico de santiago at the same time the international exposition was held in the grounds of the quinta normal the city became the main hub of the national railway system the first railroad reached the city on september at the santiago estaci√≥n central railway station under construction at the time the station would be opened permanently in during those years railways connected the city to valpara√≠so as well as regions in the north and south of chile the streets of santiago were paved and by there were railway cars in the city while people used tram services on a daily basis with the arrival of the new century the city began to experience various changes related to the strong development of industry valpara√≠so which had hitherto been the economic center of the country slowly lost prominence at the expense of the capital by of the national manufacturing industry was in the capital and only in the harbor city and by major banks and shops were set up in the streets of the city center leaving valpara√≠so the enactment of the autonomous municipalities act allowed municipalities to create various administrative divisions around the then santiago departamento with the aim of improving local ruling maip√∫ √±u√±oa renca lampa and colina were to be created in providencia and barrancas in and las condes in the la victoria departamento was split with the creation of lo ca√±as in which would be split into la granja and puente alto in la florida in and la cisterna in the san cristobal hill in this period began a long process of development in an astronomical observatory was installed and the following year the first stone was placed for its meter virgin mary statue nowadays visible from various points of city however the shrine would not be completed until some decades later with the chile centennial celebrations many urban projects were undertaken the railway network was extended allowing connection of the city with its nascent suburbs by a new rail ring and route to the caj√≥n del maipo while a new railway station was built in the north of the city the mapocho station at the mapocho river s southern side the parque forestal was created and new buildings such as the museum of fine arts the barros arana public boarding school and the national library were opened in addition the work would include a sewer system covering about of the urban population the census estimated the population of santiago to be inhabitants equivalent to of the population of chile this represented an increase of from the census of i e an annual growth of almost three times the national figure this growth was mainly due to the arrival of farmers from the south who came to work in factories and railroads which were under construction however this growth was experienced on the outskirts and not in the town itself during this time the downtown district was consolidated into a commercial financial and administrative center with the establishment of various portals and locales around ahumada street and a civic district in the immediate surroundings of the palace of la moneda the latter project involved the construction of various modernist buildings for the establishment of the offices of ministries and other public services as well as commencing the construction of medium rise buildings on the other hand the traditional inhabitants of the center began to migrate out of the city to more rural areas like providencia and √±u√±oa which hosted the oligarchy and the european immigrant professionals and san miguel for middle class families furthermore in the periphery villas were built various partners from various organizations of the time modernity expanded in the city with the appearance of the first theaters the extension of the telephone network and the opening of the airport los cerrillos in among other advances the feeling that the early 20th century was an era of economic growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with the standard of living of lower social classes the growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in the great depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north leaving unemployed which added to the decline in agricultural exports resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about nationwide these unemployed workers saw santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive many migrants arrived in santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding a place they could rent widespread disease including tuberculosis claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless unemployment and living costs increased dramatically whilst the salaries of the population of santiago fell the situation would change only several years later with a new industrial boom fostered by corfo and the expansion of the state apparatus from the late 1930s at this time the aristocracy lost much of its power and the middle class composed of merchants bureaucrats and professionals acquired the role of setting national policy in this context santiago began to develop a substantial middle and lower class population while the upper classes sought refuge in the districts of the capital thus the old moneyed class trips to cousino and alameda park lost hegemony over popular entertainment venues such as the national stadium emerged in in the following decades santiago continued to grow unabated in the city accumulated inhabitants in this figure rose to residents and the census of totaled santiaguinos this growth was reflected in the urbanization of rural areas on the periphery where families of middle and lower class with stable housing were established in the urban area had an area of hectares which in reached and in to although most of the communities continued to grow it is mainly concentrated in outlying communities such as canyon to the west conchal√≠ northern and la cisterna and la granja to the south for the upper class it began to approach the foothills of las condes and la reina sector the center however lost people leaving more space for the development of trade banking and government regulation of the growth only began to be implemented during the 1960s with the creation of various development plans for greater santiago a concept that reflected the new reality of a much larger city in the intercommunal plan of santiago was released the proposed scheme set a limit of urban and semi hectares for a maximum population of inhabitants included plans for the construction of new avenues like the am√©rico vespucio avenue and panamericana route and the expansion of industrial belts the celebration of the world cup in gave new impetus to implement plans for city improvement in the santiago metropolitan park was established in the cerro san crist√≥bal began eradicating shanty towns and building new homes finally the edificio diego portales was constructed in in the new international airport pudahuel was opened and after years of discussion in construction began on the santiago metro the first phase ran beneath the western section of the alameda and was opened in the metro would become one of the most prestigious buildings in the city in the following years it continued to expand with two perpendicular lines in place by the end of building telecommunications infrastructure was also an important development of this period as reflected in the construction of the torre entel which since its construction in has become one of the symbols of the capital and the tallest structure in the country for two decades after the coup of and the establishment of the military regime major changes in urban planning did not take place until the 1980s when the government adopted a neoliberal economic model in the master plan was amended the urban area was extended to more than ha for real estate development this created urban sprawl especially in la florida with the city reaching ha in size in the early 1990s the census showed that santiago had become the country s most populous municipality with inhabitants meanwhile a strong earthquake struck the city on march although it caused few casualties it left many people homeless and destroyed many old buildings with the start of the transition to democracy in the city of santiago had surpassed the three million inhabitants with the majority living in

city s administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests and again in during the quit india movement following independence and the partition of india in the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between hindus and muslims in ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by hindu migrants from pakistan who expanded the city s population and transformed its demographics and economy by ahmedabad had become a metropolis with a population of slightly under half a million people with classical and colonial european style buildings lining the city s thoroughfares it was chosen as the capital of gujarat state after the partition of the state of bombay on may during this period a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city making it a centre for higher education science and technology ahmedabad s economic base became more diverse with the establishment of heavy and chemical industry during the same period many countries sought to emulate india s economic planning strategy and one of them south korea copied the city s second five year plan in the late 1970s the capital shifted to the newly built well planned city of gandhinagar this marked the start of a long period of decline in the city marked by a lack of development the nav nirman agitation a protest against a hike in the hostel food fees at the l d college of engineering in ahmedabad snowballed into a movement to remove chimanbhai patel then chief minister of gujarat in the 1980s a reservation policy was introduced in the country which led to anti reservation protests in and the protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to

poverty line approximately people live in slums within the city in there were registered non resident indians living in ahmedabad in forbes magazine rated ahmedabad as the fastest growing city in india and listed it as third fastest growing in the world after the chinese cities of chengdu and chongqing in it was rated india s best megacity to live in by leading market research firm imrb according to the national crime records bureau ncrb report of ahmedabad has the lowest crime rate of the indian cities with a population of more than one million in december market research firm imrb declared ahmedabad the best megacity to live in when compared to india s other megacities slightly less than half of all real estate in ahmedabad is owned by community organisations i e cooperatives and according to vrajlal sapovadia professor of the b k school of business management the spatial growth of the city is to an extent a contribution of these organisations ahmedabad cantonment provides residential zones for indian army officials in the mid 1970s and early 1980s the textile mills that were responsible for much of ahmedabad s wealth faced competition from automation and from domestic specialty looms several prominent mills closed down leaving between and people without a source of income and many moved into informal settlements in the city center the ahmedabad municipal corporation amc the governing and administrative body of the city simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services in the 1990s newly emerging pharmaceutical chemical and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums ahmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents the urban poverty rate has declined from in to in this is partly due to the strengthening of the amc and its partnership with several civil society organizations csos representing poor residents through several projects and programs see below the amc has provided utilities and basic services to slums however there are challenges that remain and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation improved water and electricity riots often rooted in religious tensions threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines finally the conception of pro poor inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of global cities of capital investment and technological innovation this has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor as of about of the population lives in formal housing the other lives in slums or chawls which are tenements for industrial workers there are approximately slum settlements in ahmedabad and of the total housing stock is public housing the population of ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space the indian census estimates that the ahmedabad slum population was of the total population in and decreased to in but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations there is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents in the 1990s the amc faced increased slum populations they found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water sewage and electricity but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low quality informal connections to address this beginning in the amc partnered with civil society organizations to create the slum networking project snp to improve basic services in slums benefitting approximately households this project also known as parivartan change involved participatory planning in which slum residents were partners alongside amc private institutions microfinance lenders and local ngos the goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure including water supply sewers individual toilets paved roads storm drainage and tree planting and community development i e the formation of resident associations women s groups community health interventions and vocational training in addition participating households were granted a minimum de facto tenure of ten years the project cost a total of rs million community members and the private sector each contributed rs million ngos provided rs million and the amc paid for the rest of the project each slum household was responsible for no more than of the cost of upgrading their home this project has generally been regarded as a success having access to basic services increased the residents working hours since most worked out of their homes it also reduced the incidence of illness particularly water borne illness and increased children s rates of school attendance the snp received the unhabitat dubai international award for best practice to improve the living environment however concerns remain about the community s responsibility and capacity for the maintenance of the new infrastructure additionally trust was weakened when the amc demolished two of slums that were upgraded as part of snp to create recreational parks according to the census hindus are the predominant religious community in the city comprising of the population followed by muslims jains christians and sikhs buddhists people following other religions and those who didn t state any religion make up the remainder ahmedabad lies at in western india at metres ft above sea level on the banks of the sabarmati river in north central gujarat it covers an area of the sabarmati frequently dried up in the summer leaving only a small stream of water and the city is in a sandy and dry area however with the execution of the sabarmati river front project and embankment the waters from the narmada river have been diverted to the sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year thereby eliminating ahmedabad s water problems the steady expansion of the rann of kutch threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state however the narmada canal network is expected to alleviate

the five founding members of asean singapore is the host of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec secretariat and pacific economic cooperation council pecc secretariat as well as many international conferences and events it is also a member of the east asia summit non aligned movement and the commonwealth of nations the english name of singapore is an anglicisation of the native malay name for the country which was in turn derived from sanskrit ‡§∏ ‡§π‡§™ ‡§∞ si·πÉhapura si·πÉha is lion pura is town or city hence the customary reference to the nation as the lion city and its inclusion in many of the nation s symbols e g its coat of arms merlion emblem however it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island sang nila utama the srivijayan prince said to have founded and named the island singapura perhaps saw a malayan tiger there are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name is firmly established the central island has also been called pulau ujong as far back as the third century ce literally island at the end of the malay peninsula in malay singapore is also referred to as the garden city for its tree lined streets and greening efforts since independence and the little red dot for how the island nation is depicted on many maps of the world and asia as a red dot also referred to as the switzerland of asia in due to its neutrality on international and regional issues the greco roman astronomer ptolemy identified a place called sabana in the general area in the second century and the earliest written record of singapore occurs in a chinese account from the third century describing the island of pu luo chung Ëí≤ ÁΩó ‰∏≠ this was itself a transliteration from the malay name pulau ujong or island at the end of the malay peninsula the nagarakretagama a javanese epic poem written in referred to a settlement on the island called tumasik possibly meaning sea town in according to the malay annals the kingdom of singapura was founded on the island by sang nila utama although the historicity of the accounts as given in the malay annals is the subject of academic debates it is nevertheless known from various documents that singapore in the 14th century then known as temasek was a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the siamese kingdoms and was a part of the indosphere of greater india these indianized kingdoms a term coined by george c≈ìd√®s were characterized by surprising resilience political integrity and administrative stability historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century its ruler parameswara was attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese forcing him to move on to melaka where he founded the sultanate of malacca archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning was abandoned around this time although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time afterwards in portuguese raiders burned down the settlement and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries by then singapore was nominally part of the johor sultanate the wider maritime region and much trade was under dutch control for the following period raffles arrived in singapore on january and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port the island was then nominally ruled by the sultan of johor who was controlled by the dutch and the bugis however the sultanate was weakened by factional division and tengku abdu r rahman and his officials were loyal to tengku rahman s elder brother tengku long who was living in exile in riau with the temenggong s help raffles managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore he offered to recognize tengku long as the rightful sultan of johor given the title of sultan hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of and to the temenggong in return sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on singapore a formal treaty was signed on february and modern singapore was born in the entire island as well as the temenggong became a british possession after a further treaty with the sultan in singapore became part of the straits settlements under the jurisdiction of british india becoming the regional capital in prior to raffles arrival there were only about a thousand people living on the island mostly indigenous malays along with a handful of chinese by the population had swelled to over more than half being chinese many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations later in the 1890s when the rubber industry also became established in malaya and singapore the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export singapore was not much affected by first world war as the conflict did not spread to southeast asia the only significant event during the war was a mutiny by the muslim sepoys from british india who were garrisoned in singapore which occurred in after hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the ottoman empire which was a muslim state the soldiers rebelled they killed their officers and several british civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non muslim troops arriving from johore and burma after the first world war the british built the large singapore naval base as part of the defensive singapore strategy originally announced in the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the japanese invasion of manchuria in when completed in at the very large cost of million it boasted what was then the largest dry dock in the world the third largest floating dock and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire british navy for six months it was defended by heavy inch naval guns stationed at fort siloso fort canning and labrador as well as a royal air force airfield at tengah air base winston churchill touted it as the gibraltar of the east and military discussions often referred to the base as simply east of suez unfortunately it was a base without a fleet the british home fleet was stationed in europe and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in asia the plan was for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency however after world war ii broke out in the fleet was fully occupied with defending britain during the second world war the imperial japanese army invaded british malaya culminating in the battle of singapore when the british force of troops surrendered on february british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british history british losses during the fighting for singapore were heavy with a total of nearly personnel captured in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in malaya about were killed or wounded of which australians made up the majority japanese casualties during the fighting in singapore amounted to killed and wounded the occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations including those of japan britain and the then colonial state of singapore japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war singapore was renamed meaning light of the south between and ethnic chinese people were killed in the subsequent sook ching massacre british forces had planned to liberate singapore in however the war ended before these operations could be carried out it was subsequently re occupied by british indian and australian forces following the japanese surrender in september meanwhile tomoyuki yamashita was tried by a us military commission for war crimes but not for crimes committed by his troops in malaya or singapore he was convicted and hanged in the philippines on february after the japanese surrender to the allies on august singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder looting and revenge killing were widespread british troops led by lord louis mountbatten supreme allied commander for southeast asia command returned to singapore to receive formal surrender of the japanese forces in the region from general itagaki seishiro on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on september and a british military administration was formed to govern the island until march much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war including harbor facilities at the port of singapore there was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition disease and rampant crime and violence high food prices unemployment and workers discontent culminated into a series of strikes in causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services by late the economy began to recover facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre war levels the failure of britain to successfully defend singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of singaporeans the decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti colonial and nationalist sentiments epitomized by the slogan merdeka or independence in the malay language the british on their part were prepared to gradually increase self governance for singapore and malaya on april the straits settlements was dissolved and singapore became a separate crown colony with a civil administration headed by a governor in july separate executive and legislative councils were established and the election of six members of the legislative council was scheduled in the following year during the 1950s chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government leading to the malayan emergency the national service riots chinese middle schools riots and hock lee bus riots in singapore were all linked to these events david marshall pro independence leader of the labour front won singapore s first general election in he led a delegation to london but britain rejected his demand for complete self rule he resigned and was replaced by lim yew hock in whose policies convinced britain to grant singapore full internal self government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs during the may elections the people s action party won a landslide victory singapore became an internally self governing state within the commonwealth with lee kuan yew as its first prime minister as a result the general elections were the first after full internal self government was granted by the british authorities singapore was not yet fully independent as the british still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations however singapore was now a recognised state governor sir william allmond codrington goode served as the first yang di pertuan negara head of state and was succeeded by yusof bin ishak despite their successes in governing singapore the pap leaders believed that singapore s future lay with malaya due to strong ties between the two nations it was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries thus solving the ongoing unemployment woes in singapore however a sizeable pro communist wing of the pap were strongly opposed to the merger fearing a loss of influence this is because the ruling party of malaya united malays national organisation was staunchly anti communist and would support the non communist faction of pap against them umno who were initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the pap government and were concerned that the large chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro communists on may malaya s prime minister tunku abdul rahman made a surprise proposal of a federation of malaysia comprising existing federation of malaya singapore brunei and the british borneo territories of north borneo and sarawak the umno leaders believed that the additional malay population in the borneo territories would offset singapore s chinese population the british government for its part believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for communism the merger referendum provided options for a merger with malaysia but no option for avoiding the merger as a result on september singapore joined with the federation of malaya the crown colony of sarawak and the crown colony of north borneo to form the new federation of malaysia under the terms of the malaysia agreement given singapore s limited size and lack of natural resources it was felt integrating with malaya would provide a route to stronger economic development the merger would also give the pap legitimacy and remove the threat of communist government over singapore however shortly after the merger the singapore state government and the malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues and communal strife culminated in the race riots in singapore on march a bomb planted by indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded killing three people and injuring others it was the deadliest of at least bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation two members of the indonesian marine corps osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said were eventually convicted and executed for the crime the explosion caused in damage to macdonald house there were many heated ideological conflicts between the two governments even on the economic front despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of malaysia in retaliation singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states the situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides because of this on august the then malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia on august the malaysian parliament voted to with singaporean delegates not present to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for singapore to separate from the federation of malaysia this gave singapore independence unusually against its own will singapore gained independence as the republic of singapore remaining within the commonwealth of nations on august with lee kuan yew as the prime minister and yusof bin ishak as the president race riots broke out once more in in the country co founded the association of southeast asian nations asean lee kuan yew became prime minister and the country progressed to a first world country lee kuan yew s emphasis on rapid economic growth support for business entrepreneurship and limitations on internal democracy shaped singapore s policies for the next half century further economic success continued through the 1980s with the unemployment rate falling to and real gdp growth averaging at about up until during the 1980s singapore began to upgrade to higher technological industries such as the wafer fabrication sector in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour singapore changi airport was opened in and singapore airlines was formed the port of singapore became one of the world s busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period singapore emerged as an important transportation hub and a major tourist destination the pap rule is termed authoritarian by some activists and opposition politicians who see the strict regulation of political and media activities by the government as an infringement on political rights in response the government of singapore underwent several significant changes non constituency members of parliament were introduced in to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as mps group representation constituencies grcs was introduced in to create multi seat electoral divisions intended to ensure minority representation in parliament nominated members of parliament were introduced in to allow non elected non partisan mps the constitution was amended in to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of national reserves and appointments to public office the opposition parties have complained that the grc system has made it difficult for them to gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in singapore and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties in goh chok tong succeeded lee and became singapore s second prime minister during goh s tenure the country went through some post independence crises such as the asian financial crisis and the sars outbreak in lee hsien loong the eldest son of lee kuan yew became the country s third prime minister lee hsien loong s tenure included the global financial crisis the resolution of a dispute over malayan railways land and the introduction of integrated resorts despite the economy s exceptional growth the people s action party pap suffered its worst election results in winning of votes amidst hot button issues of high influx of foreign workers and cost of living on march lee kuan yew passed away during the 50th year of independence declaring a one week period of public mourning subsequently the pap maintained its dominance in parliament at the september general elections receiving of the popular vote behind the tally of and the tally of on june singapore hosted a historic summit between u s president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un the first ever meeting between the sitting leaders of the two nations the summit took place at the capella resort on the island of sentosa singapore is a parliamentary republic with a westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government representing constituencies the country s constitution establishes a representative democracy as the political system executive power rests with the cabinet of singapore led by the prime minister and to a much lesser extent the president the president is elected through a popular vote and has veto powers over a specific set of executive decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of judges but otherwise occupies a largely ceremonial post the parliament serves as the legislative branch of the government members of parliament mps consist of elected non constituency and nominated members elected mps are voted into the parliament on a first past the post plurality basis and represent either single member or group representation constituencies the people s action party has won control of parliament with large majorities in every election since self governance was secured in multiracialism a key reason for its separation from malaysia is enshrined in its constitution since independence and continues to shape major national policies in education housing politics and others freedom house ranks singapore as partly free in its freedom in the world report and the economist ranks singapore as a flawed democracy the second best rank of four in its democracy index the latest elections were in september with the pap winning of seats contested with of the popular vote the legal system of singapore is based on english common law but with substantial local differences trial by jury was abolished in so that judicial decisions would rest entirely in the hands of appointed judges singapore has penalties that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning which may be imposed for such offences as rape rioting vandalism and certain immigration offences there is capital punishment in singapore for murder as well as for certain aggravated drug trafficking and firearms offences amnesty international has said that some legal provisions of the singapore system conflict with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty the government has disputed amnesty s claims stating that their position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally and that the report contains grave errors of facts and misrepresentations singapore s judicial system is considered one of the most reliable in asia singapore has been consistently rated among the least corrupt countries in the world by transparency international singapore s unique combination of a strong almost authoritarian government with an emphasis on meritocracy and good governance is known as the singapore model and is regarded as a key factor behind singapore s political stability economic growth and harmonious social order in the world justice project s rule of law index ranked singapore among the top countries surveyed with regard to order and security absence of corruption and effective criminal justice however the country received a much lower ranking for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly all public gatherings of five or more people require police permits and protests may legally be held only at the speakers corner in constitutional amendments provide for reserved presidential elections for a community in singapore if no one from that community has been president for any of the five most recent terms of office of the president the communities are the chinese community the malay community and the indian or other minority communities candidates are required to satisfy the usual qualification criteria in halimah yacob was named the first female president of singapore in the first reserved election for the malay community she won on nomination day since all other candidates were declared ineligible for the election singapore s foreign policy is aimed at maintaining security in southeast asia and surrounding territories an underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region it has diplomatic relations with more than sovereign states as one of the five founding members of asean it is a strong supporter of the asean free trade area afta and the asean investment area because singapore s economy is closely linked to that of the region as a whole former prime minister goh chok tong proposed the formation of an asean economic community a step beyond the current afta bringing it closer to a common market this was agreed to in for implementation by other regional organisations are important to singapore and it is the host of the apec secretariat singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations such as asia europe meeting the forum for east asia latin american cooperation the indian ocean rim association and the east asia summit it is also a member of the non aligned movement and the commonwealth while singapore is not a formal member of the g20 it has been invited to participate in g20 processes in most years since in general bilateral relations with other asean members are strong however disagreements have arisen and relations with neighbouring malaysia and indonesia have sometimes been strained malaysia and singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to singapore and access by the singapore armed forces to malaysian airspace border issues exist with malaysia and indonesia and both have banned the sale of marine sand to singapore over disputes about singapore s land reclamation some previous disputes such as the pedra branca dispute have been resolved by the international court of justice piracy in the strait of malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries close economic ties exist with brunei and the two share a pegged currency value through a currency interchangeability agreement between the two countries which makes both brunei dollar and singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender in either country the first diplomatic contact with china was made in the 1970s with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s since then the two countries have been major players in strengthening the asean china relationship and has maintained a long standing and greatly prioritized close relationship partly due to china s growing influence and essentiality in the asia pacific region specifying that its common interest with china is far greater than any differences furthermore singapore has positioned itself as a strong supporter for china s constructive engagement and peaceful development in the region in addition china has been singapore s largest trading partner since after surpassing malaysia singapore and the united states share a long standing close relationship in particular in defence the economy health and education singapore has also pushed regional counter terrorism initiatives with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders to this end the country has step up cooperation with asean members and china to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism as well as participating in the organisation s first joint maritime exercise with the latter it has also given support to the us led coalition to fight terrorism with bilateral co operation in counter terrorism and counter proliferation initiatives and joint military exercises the singaporean military is arguably the most technologically advanced in southeast asia it comprises the singapore army republic of singapore navy and republic of singapore air force it is seen as the guarantor of the country s independence this principle translates into the culture involving all citizens in the country s defence the government spends of the country s gdp on the military high by regional standards and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence after its independence singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by british officers this force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country so development of its military forces became a priority britain pulled its military out of singapore in october leaving behind only a small british australian and new zealand force as a token military presence the last british soldier left singapore in march new zealand troops were the last to leave in a great deal of initial support came from israel a country that is not recognised by the neighbouring muslim majority nations of malaysia indonesia or brunei the main fear after independence was an invasion by malaysia israeli defense force idf commanders were tasked with creating the singapore armed forces saf from scratch and israeli instructors were brought in to train singaporean soldiers military courses were conducted according to the idf s format and singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the israeli model singapore still maintains strong security ties with israel and is one of the biggest buyers of israeli arms and weapons systems the matador anti tank weapon is one example of recent singaporean israeli collaboration the saf is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare the defence science and technology agency is responsible for procuring resources for the military the geographic restrictions of singapore mean that the saf must plan to fully repulse an attack as they can not fall back and re group the small size of the population has also affected the way the saf has been designed with a small active force but a large number of reserves singapore has conscription for all able bodied males at age except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families males who have yet to complete pre university education or are awarded the public service commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft though not required to perform military service the number of women in the saf has been increasing since they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces recruits undergo at least weeks of basic military training because of the scarcity of open land on the main island training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands typically barred to civilian access this also avoids risk to the main island and the city however large scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area and since have been performed in taiwan training is also held in about a dozen other countries in general military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week due to airspace and land constraints

most populous portuguese speaking capital city in the world after bras√≠lia the city is currently undergoing a major reconstruction with many large developments taking place that will alter its cityscape significantly portuguese explorer paulo dias de novais founded luanda on january as s√£o paulo da assump√ß√£o de loanda with one hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers in the portuguese built the fortress called fortaleza s√£o pedro da barra and they subsequently built two more fortaleza de s√£o miguel and forte de s√£o francisco do penedo of these the fortaleza de s√£o miguel is the best preserved luanda was portugal s bridgehead from except during the dutch rule of luanda from to as fort aardenburgh the city served as the centre of slave trade to brazil from circa to the slave trade was conducted mostly with the portuguese colony of brazil brazilian ships were the most numerous in the port of luanda this slave trade also involved local merchants and warriors who profited from the trade during this period no large scale territorial conquest was intended by the portuguese only a few minor settlements were established in the immediate hinterland of luanda some on the last stretch of the kwanza river in the 17th century the imbangala became the main rivals of the mbundu in supplying slaves to the luanda market in the 1750s between and slaves were annually sold by this time angola a portuguese colony was in fact like a colony of brazil paradoxically another portuguese colony a strong degree of brazilian influence was noted in luanda until the independence of brazil in in the 19th century still under portuguese rule luanda experienced a major economic revolution the slave trade was abolished in and in angola s ports were opened to foreign shipping by luanda was one of the greatest and most developed portuguese cities in the vast portuguese empire outside continental portugal full of trading companies exporting together with benguela palm and peanut oil wax copal timber ivory cotton coffee and cocoa among many other products maize tobacco dried meat and cassava flour are also produced locally the angolan bourgeoisie was born by this time in governor brito capelo opened the gates of an aqueduct which supplied the city with water a formerly scarce resource laying the foundation for major growth like most of portuguese angola the cosmopolitan city of luanda was not affected by the portuguese colonial war economic growth and development in the entire region reached record highs during this period in a report called luanda the paris of africa throughout portugal s estado novo period luanda grew from a town of with of those inhabitants being white in to a wealthy cosmopolitan major city of in with europeans and around mixed race inhabitants luanda has also become one of the world s most expensive cities by the time of angolan independence in luanda was a modern city the majority of its population was african but it was dominated by a strong minority of white portuguese origin after the carnation revolution in lisbon on april with the advent of independence and the start of the angolan civil war most of the white portuguese luandans left as refugees principally for portugal with many travelling overland to south africa there was an immediate crisis however as the local african population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the city and maintain its well developed infrastructure the large numbers of skilled technicians among the force of cuban soldiers sent in to support the popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla government in the angolan civil war were able to make a valuable contribution to restoring and maintaining basic services in the city in the following years however slums called musseques which had existed for decades began to grow out of proportion and stretched several kilometres beyond luanda s former city limits as a result of the decades long civil war and because of the rise of deep social inequalities due to large scale migration of civil war refugees from other angolan regions for decades luanda s facilities were not adequately expanded to handle this huge increase in the city s population after with the end of the civil war and high economic growth rates fuelled by the wealth provided by the increasing oil and diamond production major reconstruction started luanda is divided into two parts the baixa de luanda lower luanda the old city and the cidade alta upper city or the new part the baixa de luanda is situated next to the port and has narrow streets and old colonial buildings however vast new constructions have by now covered large areas beyond these traditional limits and a number of previously independent nuclei like viana were incorporated into the city since luanda province is divided into municipalities all of the municipalities except those transferred from bengo province in namely icolo e bengo and qui√ßama may be considered part of greater luanda they comprise the km2 area that was formerly the limits of luanda province before the transfers the city of luanda is divided in seven urban districts ingombota kilamba kiaxi maianga ngola kiluanj rangel samba e sambizanga a completely new satellite city called luanda sul has been built in camama zango and kilamba kiaxi more high rise developments are to be built the capital luanda is growing constantly and in addition increasingly beyond the official city limits and even provincial boundaries luanda is the seat of a roman catholic archbishop it is also the location of most of angola s educational institutions including the private catholic university of angola and the public university of agostinho neto it is also the home of the colonial governor s palace and the est√°dio da cidadela the citadel stadium angola s main stadium with a total seating capacity of luanda sul is a satellite city of luanda a small stream flows in southern luanda sul starting near the quatro de fevereiro airport and emptying into the atlantic ocean luanda international school is in viana luanda has a hot semi arid climate k√∂ppen climate classification bsh the climate is warm to hot but surprisingly dry owing to the cool benguela current which prevents moisture from easily condensing into rain frequent fog prevents temperatures from falling at night even during the completely dry months from june to october luanda has an annual rainfall of but the variability is among the highest in the world with a co efficient of variation above percent observed records since range from in to in the short rainy season in march and april depends on a northerly counter current bringing moisture to the city it has been shown clearly that weakness in the benguela current can increase rainfall about sixfold compared with years when that current is strong the inhabitants of luanda are primarily members of african ethnic groups mainly ambundu ovimbundu and bakongo the official and the most widely used language is portuguese although several bantu languages are also used chiefly kimbundu umbundu and kikongo there is a sizable minority population of european origin especially portuguese about as well as brazilians and other latin americans over the last decades a significant chinese community has formed as has a much smaller vietnamese community there is a sprinkling of immigrants from other african countries as well including a small expatriate south african community a small number of people of luanda are of mixed race european portuguese and native african in recent years mainly since the mid 2000s immigration from portugal has increased due to portugal s recession and poor economic situation the population of luanda has grown dramatically in recent years due in large part to war time migration to the city which is safe compared to the rest of the country luanda however in saw an increase in violent crime particularly in the shanty towns that surround the colonial urban core around one third of angolans live in luanda of whom live in poverty living conditions in luanda are poor for most of the people with essential services such as safe drinking water and electricity still in short supply and severe shortcomings in traffic conditions on the other hand luxury constructions for the benefit of the wealthy minority are booming luanda is one of the world s most expensive cities for resident foreigners new import tariffs imposed in march made luanda even more expensive as an example a half litre tub of vanilla ice cream at the supermarket was reported to cost us the higher import tariffs applied to hundreds of items from garlic to cars the stated aim was to try to diversify the heavily oil dependent economy and nurture farming and industry sectors which have remained weak these tariffs have caused much hardship in a country where the average salary was us in the latest year for which data was available however the average salary in the booming oil industry was over times higher at us manufacturing includes processed foods beverages textiles cement and other building materials plastic products metalware cigarettes and shoes clothes petroleum found in nearby off shore deposits is refined in the city although this facility was repeatedly damaged during the angolan civil war of luanda has an excellent natural harbour the chief exports are coffee cotton sugar diamonds iron and salt the city also has a thriving building industry an effect of the nationwide economic boom experienced since when political stability returned with the end of the civil war economic growth is largely supported by oil extraction activities although great diversification is taking place large investment domestic and international along with strong economic growth has dramatically increased construction of all economic sectors in the city of luanda in the first modern shopping mall in angola was established in the city at belas shopping mall luanda is the starting point of the luanda railway that goes due east to malanje the civil war left the railway non functional but the railway has been restored up to dondo and malanje the main airport of luanda is quatro de fevereiro airport which is the largest in the country currently a new international airport angola international airport is under construction southeast of the city a few kilometres from viana which was expected to be opened in however as the angolan government did not continue to make the payments due to the chinese enterprise in charge of the construction the firm suspended its work in the port of luanda serves as the largest port of angola and connects angola to the rest of the world major expansion of this port is also taking place in a new port is being developed at dande about km to the north luanda s roads are in a poor state of repair but are currently undergoing an extensive reconstruction process by the government in order to relieve traffic congestion in the city major road repairs can be found taking place in nearly every neighbourhood including a major lane highway connected luanda to viana public transit is provided by the suburban services of the luanda railway by the public company tcul and by a large fleet of privately owned collective taxis as white blue painted minibuses called candongueiro candongueiros are usually toyota hiace vans that are built to carry people although the candongueiros usually carry at least people they charge from to kwanzas per trip they are known to disobey traffic rules for example not stopping at signs and driving over pavements and aisles their stop points known as paragens are often the places cause significant traffic because they often double park there is also a private bus company transportes urbanos rodoviarios de angola tura working routes in luanda the central government supposedly allocates funds to all regions of the country but the capital region receives the bulk of these funds since the end of the angolan civil war stability has been widespread in the country and major reconstruction has been going on since in those parts of the country that were damaged during the civil war luanda has been of major concern because its population had multiplied and had far outgrown the capacity of the city especially because much of its infrastructure water electricity roads etc had become obsolete and degraded luanda has been undergoing major road reconstruction in the 21st century and new highways are planned to improve connections to cacuaco viana samba and the new airport major social housing is also being constructed to house those who reside in slums which dominate the landscape of luanda a large chinese firm has been given a contract to construct the majority of replacement housing in luanda the angolan minister of health recently stated poverty in angola will be overcome by an increase in jobs and the housing of every citizen universities international schools in luanda in luanda together with namibe today s mo√ß√¢medes hosted the firs men s roller hockey world cup the first time that a world cup of roller hockey was held in africa the city is home to the desportivo do bengo football club luanda makes widespread use of an unusual variant of the median u turn type intersection this eliminates the need for traffic lights and encourages free flow traffic on many main roads around the city the intersection operates by not permitting the left turn at intersections angola drives on the right a driver entering from a minor road wanting to turn left is required to join the main road traffic and proceed a u turn and then backtrack in the opposite direction and then make a safe right turn the advantages disadvantages the government of angola takes a bold view of property rights and has been known to relocate property owners at short notice where the land is required to make space for the bulged u turns it is unclear whether this intersection design has been in use prior or since the civil war the luanda traffic is notoriously congested with gridlock and so arguably this intersection worsens the situation by lengthening the routes luanda is twinned with

assigned to what were called communal apartments kommunalkas by the 1930s of the population lived in such housing in a new general plan was outlined whereby the city should expand to the south constructivism was rejected in favor of a more pompous stalinist architecture moving the city center further from the border with finland stalin adopted a plan to build a new city hall with a huge adjacent square at the southern end of moskovsky prospekt designated as the new main street of leningrad after the winter soviet finnish war in the soviet finnish border moved northwards nevsky

leningrad following the axis invasion of the soviet union in june the siege lasted days or almost two and a half years from september to january the siege of leningrad proved one of the longest most destructive and most lethal sieges of a major city in modern history it isolated the city from food supplies except those provided through the road of life across lake ladoga which could not make it through until the lake literally froze more than one million civilians were killed mainly from starvation many others escaped or were evacuated so the city became largely depopulated on may joseph stalin in his supreme commander order no named leningrad alongside stalingrad sevastopol and odessa hero cities of the war a law acknowledging the honorary title of hero city passed on may the 20th anniversary of the victory in the great patriotic war during the brezhnev era the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr awarded leningrad as a hero city the order of lenin and the gold star

pre war plans the general plan for leningrad featured radial urban development in the north as well as in the south in pavlovsky district in leningrad oblast was abolished and parts of its territory including pavlovsk merged with leningrad in the settlements levashovo pargolovo and pesochny merged with leningrad leningrad gave its name to the leningrad affair a notable event in the postwar political struggle in the ussr it was a product of rivalry between stalin s potential successors where one side was represented by the leaders of the city communist party organization the second most significant one in the country after moscow the entire elite leadership of leningrad was destroyed including the former mayor kuznetsov the acting mayor pyotr sergeevich popkov and all their deputies overall leaders were sentenced to the death penalty to prison or exile exonerated in about ranking officials across the ussr were expelled from the party and the komsomol and removed from leadership positions they were accused of russian nationalism the leningrad metro underground rapid transit system designed before the war opened in with its first eight stations decorated with marble and bronze however after the death of stalin in the perceived ornamental excesses of the stalinist architecture were abandoned from the 1960s to the 1980s many new residential boroughs were built on the outskirts while the functionalist apartment blocks were nearly identical to each other many families moved there from kommunalkas in the city centre in order to live in separate apartments on june simultaneously with the first russian presidential elections the city authorities arranged for the mayoral elections and a referendum upon the name of the city the turnout was of the total count of votes went to anatoly sobchak who became the first directly elected mayor of the city meanwhile economic conditions started to deteriorate as the country tried to adapt to major changes for the first time since the 1940s food rationing was introduced and the city received humanitarian food aid from abroad this dramatic time was depicted in photographic series of russian photographer alexey titarenko economic conditions began to improve only at the beginning of the 21st century in a northern section of the kirovsko vyborgskaya line of the saint petersburg metro was cut off by underground flooding creating a major obstacle to the city development for almost ten years in vladimir yakovlev defeated anatoly sobchak in the elections for the head of the city administration the title of the city head was changed from mayor to governor in yakovlev won re election his second term expired in the long awaited restoration of broken subway connection was expected to finish by that time but in yakovlev suddenly resigned leaving the governor s office to valentina matviyenko the law on election of the city governor was changed breaking the tradition of democratic election by a universal suffrage in the city legislature re approved matviyenko as governor residential building had intensified again real estate prices inflated greatly which caused many new problems for the preservation of the historical part of the city although the central part of the city has a unesco designation there are about architectural monuments in petersburg the preservation of its historical and architectural environment became controversial after the demolition of older buildings in the historical centre was permitted in gazprom announced an ambitious project to erect a skyscraper the okhta center opposite to smolny which could result in the loss of the unique line of petersburg landscape urgent protests by citizens and prominent public figures of russia against this project were not considered by governor valentina matviyenko and the city authorities until december when after the statement of president dmitry medvedev the city decided to find a more appropriate location for this project in the same year the new location for the project was relocated to lakhta a historical area northwest of the city center and the new project would be named lakhta center construction was approved by gazprom and the city administration and commenced in the high lakhta center has become the first tallest skyscraper in russia and europe that is outside of moscow the area of saint

the city s territory west of liteyny prospekt is no higher than above sea level and has suffered from numerous floods floods in saint petersburg are triggered by a long wave in the baltic sea caused by meteorological conditions winds and shallowness of the neva bay the five most disastrous floods occurred in above sea level during which over buildings were destroyed and to prevent floods the saint petersburg dam has been constructed since the 18th century the terrain in the city has been raised artificially at some places by more than making mergers of several islands and changing the hydrology of the city besides the neva and its tributaries other important rivers of the federal subject of saint petersburg are sestra okhta and izhora the largest lake is sestroretsky razliv in the north followed by lakhtinsky razliv suzdal lakes and other smaller lakes due to its northerly location at ca n latitude the day length in petersburg varies across seasons ranging from hours minutes to

under the k√∂ppen climate classification saint petersburg is classified as dfb a humid continental climate distinct moderating influence of the baltic sea cyclones result in warm humid and short summers and long moderately cold wet winters the climate of saint petersburg is close to that of helsinki although colder in winter and warmer in summer because of its more eastern location the

with snow cover which reaches an average snow depth of by february the frost free period in the city lasts on average for about days despite st petersburg s northern location its winters are warmer than moscow s due to the gulf of finland and some gulf stream influence from scandinavian winds that can bring temperature slightly above freezing the city also has a slightly warmer climate than its suburbs weather conditions are quite variable all year round the first and fairly rich chapter of the history of the local toponymy is the story of the own name of the city itself the name day of peter i falls on june when the russian orthodox church observes the memory of saint apostles peter and paul the consecration of the small wooden church in their names its construction began simultaneously with the citadel made them the heavenly patrons of the peter and paul fortress while st peter at the same time became the eponym of the whole city in june peter the great officially gave the site the name sankt pieter burkh an emulation of dutch topografical suffix burg which refers to fortified towns and places as peter was a neerlandophile which was subsequently russified a to letter long name composed of the three roots proved too cumbersome and a lot of shortened versions appeared in habitual use the first general governor of the city menshikov is maybe also the author of the first nickname of petersburg which he called –ø–µ—Ç—Ä–∏ petri it took some years until the known russian spelling of this name finally settled in 1740s mikhail lomonosov uses a derivative of petropolis –ø–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Å in a russified form petropol –ø–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª—å a combo piterpol –ø–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–ø–æ–ª also appears at this time in any case eventually the usage of prefix sankt ceased except for the formal official documents where a three letter abbreviation —Å–ø–± spb was very widely used as well in the 1830s alexander pushkin translated the foreign city name of saint petersburg to the more russian petrograd in one of his poems however it was only on after the war with germany had begun that tsar nicholas ii renamed the capital to petrograd since the prefix saint was omitted this act also changed the eponym and the patron of the city from apostle peter to peter the great its founder after the october revolution the name red petrograd –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ was often used in newspapers and other prints until the city was renamed leningrad in january a referendum on reversing the renaming of leningrad was held on june with of voters with a turnout of supporting saint petersburg renaming the city petrograd was not an option this change officially took effect on september meanwhile the oblast whose administrative center is also in saint petersburg is still named leningrad having passed the role of capital to petersburg moscow never relinquished the title of capital being called pervoprestolnaya first throned for years an equivalent name for petersburg the northern capital has re entered usage today since several federal institutions were recently moved from moscow to saint petersburg solemn descriptive names like the city of three revolutions and the cradle of the october revolution used in soviet era are reminders of the pivotal events in national history that occurred here for their part poetic names of the city like the venice of the north and the northern palmyra emphasize town planning and architectural features contrasting these parallels to the northern location of this megalopolis petropolis is a translation of a city name to greek and is also a kind of descriptive name is a greek root for stone so the city from stone emphasizes the material that had been forcibly made obligatory for construction from the

colonial era name rangoon likely is derived from the anglicization of the arakanese pronunciation of yangon which is yangon was founded as dagon in the early 11th century by the mon who dominated lower burma at that time dagon was a small fishing village centred about the shwedagon pagoda in king alaungpaya conquered dagon renamed it yangon and added settlements around dagon the british captured yangon during the first anglo burmese war but returned it to burmese administration after the war the city was destroyed by a fire in the british seized yangon and all of lower burma in the second anglo burmese war of and subsequently transformed yangon into the commercial and political hub of british burma in the british moved the capital of burma from moulmein present day mawlamyine to yangon yangon is also the place where the british sent bahadur shah ii the last mughal emperor to live after the indian rebellion of based on the design by army engineer lt alexander fraser the british constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land bounded to the east by the pazundaung creek and to the south and west by the yangon river yangon became the capital of all british ruled burma after the british had captured upper burma in the third anglo burmese war of by the 1890s yangon s increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of royal lake kandawgyi and inya lake the british also established hospitals including rangoon general hospital and colleges including rangoon university colonial yangon with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture was known as the garden city of the east by the early 20th century yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with london before world war ii about of yangon s population of was indian or south asian and only about a third was bamar burman karens the chinese the anglo burmese and others made up the rest after world war i yangon became the epicentre of burmese independence movement with leftist rangoon university students leading the way three nationwide strikes against the british empire in and all began in yangon yangon was under japanese occupation and incurred heavy damage during world war ii the city was retaken by the allies in may yangon became the capital of the union of burma on january when the country regained independence from the british empire soon after burma s independence in many colonial names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic burmese names in the current military junta changed the city s english name to yangon along with many other changes in english transliteration of burmese names the changes have not been accepted by many burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes nor by many publications and news bureaus including most notably the bbc and foreign nations including the united kingdom and united states since independence yangon has expanded outwards successive governments have built satellite towns such as thaketa north okkalapa and south okkalapa in the 1950s to hlaingthaya shwepyitha and south dagon in the 1980s today greater yangon encompasses an area covering nearly during ne win s isolationist rule yangon s infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population in the 1990s the current military government s more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment bringing a modicum of modernity to the city s infrastructure some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns many colonial period buildings were demolished to make way for high rise hotels office buildings and shopping malls leading the city government to place about notable colonial period buildings under the yangon city heritage list in major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country still much of yangon remains without basic municipal services such as hour electricity and regular garbage collection yangon has become much more indigenous burmese in its ethnic make up since independence after independence many south asians and anglo burmese left many more south asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by ne win s xenophobic government nevertheless sizeable south asian and chinese communities still exist in yangon the anglo burmese have effectively disappeared having left the country or intermarried with other burmese groups yangon was the centre of major anti government protests in and the people power uprising resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of burmese civilians many in yangoon where hundreds of thousands of people flooded into the streets of the then capital city the saffron revolution saw mass shootings and the use of crematoria in yangoon by the burmese government to erase evidence of their crimes against monks unarmed protesters journalists and students the city s streets saw bloodshed each time as protesters were gunned down by the government in may cyclone nargis hit yangon while the city had few human casualties three quarters of yangon s industrial infrastructure was destroyed or damaged with losses estimated at us million in november the military government designated naypyidaw north of yangon as the new administrative capital and subsequently moved much of the government to the newly developed city at any rate yangon remains the largest city and the most important commercial centre of myanmar yangon is located in lower burma myanmar at the convergence of the yangon and bago rivers about km mi away from the gulf of martaban at north east its standard time zone is utc gmt hours yangon has a tropical monsoon climate under the k√∂ppen climate classification system the city features a lengthy wet season from may through october where a substantial amount of rainfall is received and a dry season from november through april where little rainfall is seen it is primarily due to the heavy rainfall received during the rainy season that yangon falls under the tropical monsoon climate category during the course of the year to 1990s average temperatures show little variance with average highs ranging from and average lows ranging from until the mid 1990s yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the bago yangon and hlaing rivers people moved in but little of the city moved out maps from show little development north of inya lake and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters since the late 1980s however the city began a rapid spread north to where yangon international airport now stands but the result is a stretching tail on the city with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre the city s area has steadily increased from in to in to in to in and to in downtown yangon is known for its leafy avenues and fin de si√®cle architecture the former british colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in south east asia downtown yangon is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings the former high court the former secretariat buildings the former st paul s english high school and the strand hotel are excellent examples of the bygone era most downtown buildings from this era are four story mix use residential and commercial buildings with ceilings allowing for the construction of mezzanines despite their less than perfect conditions the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city s property market in the yangon city development committee created a yangon city heritage list of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval in the city of yangon imposed a year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than years the yangon heritage trust an ngo started by thant myint u aims to create heritage areas in downtown and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use a latter day hallmark of yangon is the eight story apartment building in yangon parlance a building with no elevators lifts is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a condominium condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most yangonites found throughout the city in various forms eight story apartment buildings provide relatively inexpensive housing for many yangonites the apartments are usually eight stories high including the ground floor mainly because city regulations until february required that all buildings higher than or eight stories to install lifts the current code calls for elevators in buildings higher than or six stories likely ushering in the era of the six story apartment building although most apartment buildings were built only within the last years they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance unlike other major asian cities yangon does not have any skyscrapers aside from a few high rise hotels and office towers most high rise buildings usually stories and up are condos scattered across prosperous neighbourhoods north of downtown such as bahan dagon kamayut and mayangon the tallest building in yangon pyay gardens is a story condo in the city s north older satellite towns such as thaketa north okkalapa and south okkalapa are lined mostly with one to two story detached houses with access to the city s electricity grid newer satellite towns such as north dagon and south dagon are still essentially slums in a grid layout the satellite towns old or new receive little or no municipal services downtown yangon s road layout follows a grid pattern based on four types of roads the east west grid of central was laid out by british military engineers fraser and montgomerie after the second anglo burmese war the city was later developed by the public works department and bengal corps of engineers the pattern of south to north roads is as follows one broad wide broad road two narrow streets one mid size street two more narrow streets and then another wide broad road this order is repeated from west to east the narrow streets are numbered the medium and broad roads are named for example the lanmadaw road is followed by wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium sint oh dan road the foot 19th and 20th streets followed by another wide latha road followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets and so on the roads running parallel west to east were the strand road merchant road maha bandula n√©e dalhousie road anawrahta fraser road and bogyoke aung san montgomerie road the largest and best maintained parks in yangon are located around shwedagon pagoda to the south east of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city kandawgyi lake the acre ha lake is surrounded by the acre ha kandawgyi nature park and the acre ha yangon zoological gardens which consists of a zoo an aquarium and an amusement park west of the pagoda towards the former hluttaw parliament complex is the acre ha people s square and park the former parading ground on important national days when yangon was the capital a few miles north of the pagoda lies the acre ha inya lake park a favourite hangout place of yangon university students and a well known place of romance in burmese popular culture hlawga national park and allied war memorial at the outskirts of the city are popular day trip destinations with the well to do and tourists yangon is administered by the yangon city development committee ycdc ycdc also coordinates urban planning the city is divided into four districts the districts combined have a total of townships the current mayor of yangon is maung maung soe each township is administered by a committee of township leaders who make decisions regarding city beautification and infrastructure myo thit lit new towns or satellite towns are not within such jurisdictions yangon is a member of asian network of major cities yangon is burma s main domestic and international hub for air rail and ground transportation yangon international airport located miles km from the centre is the country s main gateway for domestic and international air travel the airport has three terminals known as t1 t2 and t3 which is also known as domestic it has direct flights to regional cities in asia mainly doha dubai dhaka kolkata hanoi ho chi minh city hong kong tokyo beijing phnom penh seoul guangzhou taipei bangkok kuala lumpur kunming and singapore although domestic airlines offer service to about twenty domestic locations most flights are to tourist destinations such as bagan mandalay heho and ngapali and to the capital naypyidaw yangon central railway station is the main terminus of myanmar railways rail network whose reach covers upper myanmar naypyidaw mandalay shwebo upcountry myitkyina shan hills taunggyi lashio and the taninthayi coast mawlamyine dawei yangon circular railway operates a station commuter rail network that connects yangon s satellite towns the system is heavily used by the local populace selling about tickets daily the popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in august yangon has a road network of all types tar concrete and dirt in march many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars the vast majority of yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around over public and private bus lines operate about crowded buses around the city carrying over million passengers a day all buses and of the taxis in yangon run on compressed natural gas cng following the government decree to save money on imported petroleum highway buses to other cities depart from dagon ayeyar highway bus terminal for irrawaddy delta region and aung mingala highway bus terminal for other parts of the country on january city bus network system yangon bus service ybs was created motor transportation in yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens as the government allows only a few thousand cars to be imported each year in a country with over million people car prices in yangon and in burma are among the highest in the world in july the two most popular cars in yangon nissan sunny super saloon and toyota corolla se limited cost the equivalent of about us and us respectively a sports utility vehicle imported for the equivalent of around us goes for us illegally imported unregistered cars are cheaper typically about half the price of registered cars nonetheless car usage in yangon is on the rise a sign of rising incomes for some and already causes much traffic congestion in highway less yangon s streets in yangon had about registered motor vehicles in addition to an unknown number of unregistered ones since cars have been driven on the right side of the road in burma as part of a military decree however as the government has not required left hand drive lhd cars to accompany the right side road rules many cars on the road are still right hand drive rhd made for driving on the left side japanese used cars which make up most of the country s imports still arrive with rhd and are never converted to lhd as a result burmese drivers have to rely on their passengers when passing other cars within yangon city limits it is illegal to drive trishaws bicycles and motorcycles since february pick up truck bus lines have been forbidden to run in townships of central yangon namely latha lanmadaw pabedan kyauktada botahtaung and pazundaung townships in may a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of downtown yangon to reduce noise pollution in april the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city yangon s four main passenger jetties all located on or near downtown waterfront mainly serve local ferries across the river to dala and thanlyin and regional ferries to the irrawaddy delta the mile km twante canal was the quickest route from yangon to the irrawaddy delta until the 1990s when roads between yangon and the irrawaddy division became usable year round while passenger ferries to the delta are still used those to upper burma via the irrawaddy river are now limited mostly to tourist river cruises in october a new yangon water bus was launched yangon is the most populous city by far in burma although estimates of the size of its population vary widely all population figures are estimates since no official census has been conducted in burma since a un estimate puts the population as million in but a us state department estimate puts it at million the us state department s estimate is probably closer to the real number since the un number is a straight line projection and does not appear to take the expansion of city limits in the past two decades into account the city s population grew sharply after as many people mainly the indigenous burmese from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of north okkalapa south okkalapa and thaketa in the 1950s and east dagon north dagon and south dagon in the 1990s immigrants have founded their regional associations such as mandalay association mawlamyaing association etc in yangon for networking purposes the government s decision to move the nation s administrative capital to naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from yangon yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country while indians formed the slight majority prior to world war ii today the majority of the population is of indigenous bamar burman descent large communities of indians south asian burmese and the chinese burmese exist especially in the traditional downtown neighbourhoods a large number of rakhine and karen also live in the city burmese is the principal language of the city english is by far the preferred second language of the educated class in recent years however the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages mandarin chinese is most popular followed by japanese and french the primary religions practised in yangon are buddhism christianity hinduism and islam shwedagon pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city yangon is the country s hub for the movie music advertising newspaper and book publishing industries all media is heavily regulated by the military government television broadcasting is off limits to the private sector all media content must first be approved by the government s media censor board press scrutiny and registration division most television channels in the country are broadcast from yangon tv myanmar and myawaddy tv are the two main channels providing burmese language news and entertainment programmes other special interest channels are mwd and mwd mrtv the english language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via internet mrtv and channel are with a focus on non formal education programs and movies and movie a pay tv channel specialising in broadcasting foreign movies yangon has three radio stations myanmar radio national service is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in burmese and in english during specific times pop culture oriented yangon city fm and mandalay city fm radio stations specialise in burmese and english pop music entertainment programs live celebrity interviews etc new radio channels such as shwe fm and pyinsawaddy fm can also be tuned with the city area nearly all print media and industries are based out of yangon all three national newspapers two burmese language dailies myanma alin and kyemon and the english language the new light of myanmar are published by the government semi governmental the myanmar times weekly published in burmese and in english is mainly geared for yangon s expatriate community over twenty special interest journals and magazines covering sports fashion finance crime literature but never politics vie for the readership of the general populace access to foreign media is extremely difficult satellite television in yangon and in burma is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of one million kyats certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the international herald tribune and the straits times can be found only in a few mostly downtown bookstores internet access in yangon which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country is slow and erratic at best and the burmese government implements one of the world s most restrictive regimes of internet control international text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in august common facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in yangon and burma the price of a gsm mobile phone was about k1 million in august in the country of million had only phone lines including mobile phones and computers even in yangon which has the best infrastructure the estimated telephone penetration rate was only at the end of and the official waiting time for a telephone line was years most people cannot afford a computer and have to use the city s numerous internet cafes to access a heavily restricted internet and a heavily censored local intranet according to official statistics in july the country had over internet users with the vast majority hailing from just two cities yangon and mandalay although internet access was available in cities across the country the number of users outside the two main cities was just over yangon s property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most yangonites most rent outside the centre and few can afford to rent such apartments in rents for a typical apartments in the centre and vicinity range between k70 and k150 and those for high end condos between k200 and k500 most men of all ages and some women spend their time at ubiquitous tea shops found in any corner or street of the city watching european football mostly english premier league with occasional la liga serie a bundesliga matches while sipping tea is a popular pastime among many yangonites the average person stays close to his or her residential neighbourhood the well to do tend to visit shopping malls and parks on weekends some leave the city on weekends for chaungtha and ngwesaung beach resorts in ayeyarwady division yangon is also home to many pagoda festivals paya pwe held during dry season months november march the most famous of all the shwedagon pagoda festival in march attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country yangon s museums are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals most of yangon s larger hotels offer some kind of nightlife entertainment geared towards tourists and the well to do burmese some hotels offer traditional burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional burmese orchestra the pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in asia other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in yangon chinatown due to the problems of high inflation the lack of high denomination notes and the fact that many of the population do not have access to checks or credit or debit cards it is common to see citizens carrying a considerable amount of cash the highest denomination of burmese currency kyat is us credit cards are only rarely used in the city chiefly in the more lavish hotels credit cards are also accepted in the major supermarket and convenience store chains as the city has the best sporting facilities in the country most national level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field football volleyball tennis and swimming are held in yangon the seat aung san stadium and the seat thuwunna stadium are the main venues for the highly popular annual state and division football tournament until april the now defunct myanmar premier league consisted of yangon based clubs played all its matches in yangon stadiums and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in burma most yangonites prefer watching european football on satellite tv teams such as manchester united liverpool chelsea real madrid barcelona bayern munich and manchester city are among the favourite european teams among the yangonites it remains to be seen whether the myanmar national league the country s first professional football league and its yangon based club yangon united fc will attract a sufficient following in the country s most important media market yangon is also home to annual the myanmar open golf tournament and the myanmar open tennis tournament the city hosted the and south east asian games during colonial times cricket was played mostly by british officials in the city first class cricket was played in the city in january when the touring marylebone cricket club played burma and the rangoon gymkhana two grounds were used to host these matches the baa ground and the gymkhana ground these matches mark the only time burma and rangoon gymkhana have appeared in first class cricket and the only time first class cricket has been played in burma after independence cricket all but died out in the country yangon has a growing population of skateboarders as documented in the films and youth of yangon german non profit organisation make life skate life has received permission from the yangon city development committee to construct a concrete skatepark at thakin mya park in downtown and plans to complete the park in november yangon is the country s main centre for trade industry real estate media entertainment and tourism the city represents about one fifth of the national economy according to official statistics for fy the size of the economy of yangon region was trillion kyats or of the national gdp the city is lower burma s main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise from basic food stuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city s severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure bayinnaung market is the largest wholesale centre in the country for rice beans and pulses and other agricultural commodities much of the country s legal imports and exports go through thilawa port the largest and busiest port in burma there is also a great deal of informal trade especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms of downtown yangon s townships however on june the ycdc announced that street vendors who had previously been allowed to legally open shop at pm would be prohibited from selling on the streets and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence presumably to clean up the city s image since december high density polyethylene plastic bags have been banned by city authorities manufacturing accounts for a sizeable share of employment at least light industrial zones ring yangon directly employing over workers in factories in early the city is the centre of country s garment industry which exported us million in fiscal year more than percent of factory workers in yangon work on a day to day basis most are young women between and years of age who come from the countryside in search of a better life the manufacturing sector suffers from both structural problems e g chronic power shortages and political problems e g economic sanctions in yangon s factories alone needed about mw of power yet the entire city received only about mw of the mw needed chronic power shortages limit the factories operating hours between am and pm construction is a major source of employment the construction industry has been negatively affected by the move of state apparatus and civil servants to naypyidaw new regulations introduced in august requiring builders to provide at least parking spaces in every new high rise building and the general poor business climate as of january the number of new high rise building starts approved in was only compared to in tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by south east asian standards the number of foreign visitors to yangon has always been quite low about before the saffron revolution in september the number of visitors dipped even further following the saffron revolution and cyclone nargis the recent improvement in the country s political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists between and visitors that went through yangon international in however after years of underinvestment yangon s modest hotel infrastructure only of the total hotel rooms in yangon are suitable for tourists is already bursting at seams and will need to be expanded to handle additional visitors as part of an urban development strategy a hotel zone has been planned in yangon s outskirts encompassing government and military owned land in mingaladon hlegu and htaukkyant townships yangon educational facilities has a very high number of qualified teachers but the state spending on education is among the lowest of the world around estimate by the london based international institute for strategic studies puts the spending for education at of the national budget the disparity in educational opportunities and achievement between rich and poor schools is quite stark even within the city with little or no state support forthcoming schools have to rely on forced donations and various fees from parents for nearly everything school maintenance to teachers salaries forcing many poor students to drop out while many students in poor districts fail to reach high school a handful of yangon high schools in wealthier districts such as dagon sanchaung kamayut bahan latha and ttc provide the majority of students admitted to the most selective universities in the country highlighting the extreme shallowness of talent pool in the country the wealthy bypass the state education system altogether sending their children to private english language instruction schools such as yiec or more widely known as ism or abroad typically singapore or australia for university education in international schools in yangon cost at least us a year there are over universities and colleges in the city while yangon university remains the best known its main campus is a part of popular burmese culture e g literature music film etc the nation s oldest university is now mostly a graduate school deprived of undergraduate studies following the nationwide uprising the military government has repeatedly closed universities and has dispersed most of undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as dagon university the university of east yangon and the university of west yangon nonetheless many of the country s most selective universities are still in yangon students from around the country still have to come to study in yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities the university of medicine university of medicine yangon technological university university of computer studies and myanmar maritime university are the most selective in the country the general state of health care in yangon is poor according to a estimate the military government spends of the national budget on health care and to on defence by the government s own figures it spends kyats us per person although health care is nominally free in reality patients have to pay for medicine and treatment even in public clinics and hospitals public hospitals including the flagship yangon general hospital lack many of the basic facilities and equipment wealthier yangonites still have access to country s best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors only yangon and mandalay have any sizeable number of doctors left as many burmese doctors have emigrated the well to do go to private clinics or hospitals like pun hlaing international hospital and bahosi medical clinic medical malpractice is widespread even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well to do in and a spate of high profile deaths brought out the severity of the problem even for the relatively well off yangonites the wealthy do not rely on domestic hospitals and travel abroad usually bangkok or singapore for treatment the following are healthcare facilities in yangon in yangon is a member of the asian network of major cities

 sydney sydney is the state capital of new south wales and the most populous city in australia and oceania located on australia s east coast the metropolis surrounds port jackson and sprawls about on its periphery towards the blue mountains to the west hawkesbury to the north and macarthur to the south sydney is made up of suburbs local government areas and contiguous regions residents of the city are known as sydneysiders as of june sydney s estimated metropolitan population was indigenous australians have inhabited the sydney area for at least years and it remains one of the richest in australia in terms of aboriginal archaeological sites with thousands of engravings located throughout the region in during his first pacific voyage lieutenant james cook landed at sydney where he claimed possession of the east coast of australia for the british crown naming it new south wales in the first fleet of convicts led by arthur phillip arrived in botany bay to found sydney as a british penal colony the first european settlement in australia phillip named the city sydney in recognition of thomas townshend 1st viscount sydney penal transportation to new south wales ended soon after sydney was incorporated as a city in a gold rush occurred in the colony in and over the next century sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre after world war ii it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world at the time of the more than different languages were spoken in sydney and about percent of residents spoke a language other than english at home furthermore of the population reported having been born overseas despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world the mercer quality of living survey ranks sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living making it one of the most livable cities it is classified as an alpha world city by globalization and world cities research network indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance manufacturing and tourism there is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in sydney and the city is promoted as one of asia pacific s leading financial hubs established in the university of sydney is australia s first university and is regarded as one of the world s leading universities sydney is also home to the oldest library in australia state library

hyde park the oldest parkland in the country built attractions such as the sydney harbour bridge and the world heritage listed sydney opera house are also well known to international visitors the main passenger airport serving the metropolitan area is kingsford smith airport one of the world s oldest continually operating airports established in central station the largest and busiest railway station in the state is the main hub of the city s rail network the first people to inhabit the area now known as sydney were indigenous australians having migrated from northern australia and before that from southeast asia radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the sydney area from around years ago however numerous aboriginal stone tools were found in western sydney s gravel sediments that were dated from to years bp which would indicate that there was human settlement in sydney earlier than thought the first meeting between the native people and the british occurred on april when lieutenant james cook landed at botany bay on the kurnell peninsula and encountered the gweagal clan he noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement he spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for britain prior to the arrival of the british there were to native people in sydney from as many as different clans the earliest british settlers called the natives eora people eora is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the british its literal meaning is from this place sydney cove from port jackson to petersham was inhabited by the cadigal clan the principal language groups were darug guringai and dharawal the earliest europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing using trees for bark and food collecting shells and cooking fish britain before that england and ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the atlantic to the american colonies that trade was ended with the declaration of independence by the united states in britain decided in to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by cook some years earlier captain philip led the first fleet of ships and about convicts into botany bay on january though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water he travelled a short way further north and arrived at port jackson on january this was to be the location for the new colony phillip described sydney cove as being without exception the finest harbour in the world the colony was at first to be titled new albion after albion in great britain but phillip decided on sydney the official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on february lieutenant william dawes produced a town plan in but it was ignored by the colony s leaders sydney s layout today reflects this lack of planning between and male and female convicts were landed at sydney many professional criminals with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony the food situation reached crisis point in early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce from on however the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies the colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity maps from this time show no prison buildings the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the parramatta region as a promising area for expansion and moved many of the convicts from late to establish a small township which became the main centre of the colony s economic life leaving sydney cove only as an important port and focus of social life poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from farm cove to parramatta and toongabbie but a building programme assisted by convict labour advanced steadily officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land the region s indigenous population was also suffering it is estimated that half of the native people in sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of enlightened for his age phillip s personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony phillip and several of his officers most notably watkin tench left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement part of macquarie s effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re enter society as free citizens roads bridges wharves and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by the town had banks markets and well established thoroughfares parramatta road was opened in which is one of sydney s oldest roads and australia s first highway between two cities sydney cbd and parramatta conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade such as wool helped to lessen the burden of isolation between and convicts and their jailers made up the majority of the population in one generation however a population of emancipated convicts who could be granted land began to grow these people pioneered sydney s private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired and later still by free settlers who began arriving from britain governor phillip departed the colony for england on december with the new settlement having survived near starvation and immense isolation for four years between and sydney became one of the many sites of the australian frontier wars a series of conflicts between the kingdom of great britain and the resisting indigenous clans

george hospital in and the nepean hospital in westmead hospital in was the last major facility to open the motor vehicle more than any other factor has determined the pattern of sydney s urban development since world war ii the growth of low density housing in the city s outer suburbs has made car ownership necessary for hundreds of thousands of households the percentage of trips taken by car has increased from in to in and to in the most important roads in sydney were the nine metroads including the sydney orbital network widespread criticism over sydney s reliance on sprawling road networks as well as the motor vehicle have stemmed largely from proponents of mass public transport and high density housing on an international scale sydney was ranked at out of cities in the world for sustainability and effectiveness of public transport in a report by arcadis lagging behind brisbane but ahead of both melbourne and perth there can be up to cars using sydney s roads simultaneously during peak hour leading to significant traffic congestion of sydney households own a motor vehicle and own two or more car dependency is high in sydney of people that travel to work use a car catch a train take a bus and walk in contrast only of working residents in the city of sydney use a car whilst take a train use a bus and walk with a rate of sydney has the highest utilisation of public transport for travel to work of any australian capital city sydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the world it was the second largest in the british empire after london with routes covering the internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and consequently more popular leading to the progressive closure of the tram network with the final tram operating in from there were buses across sydney carrying million passengers per annum in the inner west light rail also known as the dulwich hill line opened between central station and wentworth park it was extended to lilyfield in and then dulwich hill in it links the inner west and darling harbour with central station and facilitated million journeys in the financial year a second the cbd and south east light rail line serving the cbd and south eastern suburbs is planned to open in early when the light rail project is completed it would cover a total distance of km with different stops the parramatta light rail has also been announced bus services today are conducted by a mixture of government and private operators in areas previously serviced by trams the government state transit authority operates in other areas there are private albeit part funded by the state government operators integrated tickets called opal cards operate on both government and private bus routes state transit alone operated a fleet of buses and serviced over million passengers during in total nearly million boardings were recorded across the bus network nightride is a nightly bus service that operate between midnight and 5am also replacing trains for most of this period train services are operated by sydney trains the organisation maintains stations and of railway and provides million journeys each year sydney s railway was first constructed in with progressive extension to the network to serve both freight and passengers across the city suburbs and beyond to country nsw in the 1850s and 1860s the railway reached parramatta campbelltown liverpool blacktown penrith and richmond in of trains arrived on time and of services ran as scheduled construction of sydney metro an automated rapid transit system separate from the existing suburban network started in the first stage is expected to open in with plans in place to extend the system through the cbd by at the time the sydney harbour bridge opened in the city s ferry service was the largest in the world patronage declined from million passengers in to million in but has recovered somewhat in recent years from its hub at circular quay the ferry network extends from manly to parramatta sydney airport officially sydney kingsford smith airport is located in the inner southern suburb of mascot with two of the

charter and some scheduled cargo flights bankstown is also the fourth busiest airport in australia by number of aircraft movements port botany has surpassed port jackson as the city s major shipping port cruise ship terminals are located at sydney cove and white bay as climate change greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for australia sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality since there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the sydney metropolitan region the development led to the release of the metropolitan air quality scheme maqs which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in sydney allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency especially by world city standards it also has a low level of mass transit services with a historically low density layout and significant urban sprawl thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of new nissan leaf electric cars the largest order of the pollution free vehicle in australia electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide gases which contribute to climate change cycling trips have increased by across sydney s inner city since march with about bikes passing through top peak hour intersections on an average weekday transport developments in the north west and east of the

neutral in the city has reduced its carbon emissions by and since has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to the city of sydney introduced a sustainable sydney program with various targets planned and a comprehensive guide on how to reduce energy in homes and offices within sydney by reductions in energy consumption have slashed energy bills by million a year solar panels have been established on many cbd buildings in an effort to minimise carbon pollution by around tonnes a year the city also has an urban forest growth strategy in which it aims to regular increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees with strong leaf density and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather thus lowering city temperatures sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy efficient the one central park development completed in is an example of this implementation and design obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times a catchment called the tank stream sourced water from what is now the cbd but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s the botany swamps scheme was one of several ventures during the mid 1800s that saw the construction of wells tunnels steam pumping stations and small dams to service sydney s growing population the first genuine solution to sydney s water demands was the upper nepean scheme which came into operation in and cost over million it transports water from the nepean cataract and cordeaux rivers and continues to service about of sydney s total water needs dams were built on these three rivers between and in the shoalhaven scheme brought several more

 alexandria alexandria or or is the second largest city in egypt and a major economic centre extending about along the coast of the mediterranean sea in the north central part of the country its low elevation on the nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels alexandria is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from suez alexandria is also a popular tourist destination alexandria was founded around a small ancient egyptian town by alexander the great it became an important center of hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of ptolemaic egypt and roman and byzantine egypt for almost years until the muslim conquest of egypt in ad when a new capital was founded at fustat later absorbed into cairo hellenistic alexandria was best known for the lighthouse of alexandria pharos one of the seven wonders of the ancient world its great library the largest in the ancient world now replaced by a modern one and the necropolis one of the seven wonders of the middle ages alexandria was at one time the second most powerful city of the ancient mediterranean region after rome ongoing maritime archaeology in the harbor of alexandria which began in is revealing details of alexandria both before the arrival of alexander when a city named rhacotis existed there and during the ptolemaic dynasty from the late 18th century alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the mediterranean sea and the red sea and the lucrative trade in egyptian cotton alexandria is believed to have been founded by alexander the great in april bc as alexandreia alexander s chief architect for the project was dinocrates alexandria was intended to supersede naucratis as a hellenistic center in egypt and to be the link between greece and the rich nile valley although it has long been believed only a small village there recent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show significant human activity at the location for two millennia preceding alexandria s founding alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient world for some time the city and its museum attracted many of the greatest scholars including greeks jews and syrians the city was later plundered and lost its significance in the early christian church the city was the center of the patriarchate of alexandria which was one of the major centers of early christianity in the eastern roman empire in the modern world the coptic orthodox church and the greek orthodox church of alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage just east of alexandria where abu qir bay is now there was in ancient times marshland and several islands as early as the 7th century bc there existed important port cities of canopus and heracleion the latter was recently rediscovered under water an egyptian city rhakotis already existed on the shore and later gave its name to alexandria in the egyptian language egyptian raÀÅ ·∏≥ƒÅ·π≠it written rÀÅ ·∏≥·π≠y t that which is built up it

the expansion following a struggle with the other successors of alexander his general ptolemy lagides succeeded in bringing alexander s body to alexandria though it was eventually lost after being separated from its burial site there although cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing alexandria s continuous development the heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily ptolemaic work inheriting the trade of ruined tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between europe and the arabian and indian east the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than carthage in a century alexandria had become the largest city in the world and for some centuries more was second only to rome it became egypt s main greek city with greek people from diverse backgrounds alexandria was not only a center of hellenism but was also home to the largest urban jewish community in the world the septuagint a greek version of the tanakh was produced there the early

population s three largest ethnicities greek jewish and egyptian by the time of augustus the city walls encompassed an area of sq kilometres and the total population in roman times was around according to philo of alexandria in the year of the common era disturbances erupted between jews and greek citizens of alexandria during a visit paid by the jewish king agrippa i to alexandria principally over the respect paid by the jewish nation to the roman emperor and which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of alexandrian synagogues the violence was quelled after caligula intervened and had the roman governor flaccus removed from the city in ad large parts of alexandria were destroyed during the kitos war which gave hadrian and his architect decriannus an opportunity to rebuild it in the emperor caracalla visited the city and because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms on july alexandria was devastated by a tsunami crete earthquake an event annually commemorated years later as a day of horror the islamic prophet muhammad s first interaction with the people of egypt occurred in during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha hisma he sent hatib bin abi baltaeh with a letter to the king of egypt in reality emperor heraclius and alexandria called muqawqis in the letter muhammad said i invite you to accept islam allah the sublime shall reward you doubly but if you refuse to do so you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the copts during this expedition one of muhammad s envoys dihyah bin khalifa kalbi was attacked muhammad sent zayd ibn haritha to help him dihya approached the banu dubayb a tribe which converted to islam and had good relations with muslims for help when the news reached muhammad he immediately dispatched zayd ibn haritha with men to battle the muslim army fought with banu judham killed several of them inflicting heavy casualties including their chief al hunayd ibn arid and his son and captured camels of their cattle and women and boys the new chief of the banu judham who had embraced islam appealed to muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen and muhammad released them in alexandria fell to the sassanid persians although the byzantine emperor heraclius recovered it in in the arabs under the general amr ibn al as captured it during the muslim conquest of egypt after a siege that lasted months after the battle of ridaniya in the city was conquered by the ottoman turks and remained under ottoman rule until alexandria lost much of its former importance to the egyptian port city of rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the mahmoudiyah canal in alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of napoleon s expedition to egypt in french troops stormed the city on july and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a british expedition in the british won a considerable victory over the french at the battle of alexandria on march following which they besieged the city which fell to them on september muhammad ali the ottoman governor of egypt began rebuilding and redevelopment around and by alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory egypt turned to europe in their effort to modernize the country greeks followed by other europeans and others began moving to the city in the early 20th century the city became a home for

affair on october alexandria s mansheya square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on gamal abdel nasser europeans began leaving alexandria following the suez crisis that led to an outburst of arab nationalism the nationalization of property by nasser which reached its highest point in drove out nearly all the rest in reference to alexandria egypt ibn battuta speaks of great saints that resided here one of them being imam borhan oddin el aaraj he was said to have the power of working miracles he told ibn battuta that he should go find his three brothers farid oddin who lived in india

alexandria was divided into three regions two main streets lined with colonnades and said to have been each about wide intersected in the center of the city close to the point where the sema or soma of alexander his mausoleum rose this point is very near the present mosque of nebi daniel and the line of the great east west canopic street only slightly diverged from that of the modern boulevard de rosette now sharia fouad traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the rosetta gate but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in by german excavators outside the east fortifications which lie well within the area of the ancient city alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of pharos which was joined to the mainland by a mole and called the heptastadion seven stadia a stadium was a greek unit of length measuring approximately the end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present grand square where the moon gate rose all that now lies between that point and the modern ras al tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole the ras al tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of pharos the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea on the east of the mole was the great harbor now an open bay on the west lay the port of eunostos with its inner basin kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor in strabo s time latter half of the 1st century bc the principal buildings were as follows enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the great harbor the names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known but there is little information as to their actual position none however are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of pharos island there the great lighthouse one of the seven wonders of the world reputed to be high was situated the first ptolemy began the project and the second ptolemy ptolemy ii philadelphus completed it at a total cost of talents it took years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world the light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone the pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder after the great pyramid of giza a temple of hephaestus also stood on pharos at the head of the mole in the 1st century the population of alexandria contained over adult male citizens according to a census dated from ce in addition to a large number of freedmen women children and slaves estimates of the total population range from to making it one of the largest cities ever built before the industrial revolution and the largest pre industrial city that was not an imperial capital alexandria is located in the country of egypt on the southern coast of the mediterranean alexandria has a borderline hot desert climate k√∂ppen climate classification bwh approaching a hot semi arid climate bsh as the rest of egypt s northern coast the prevailing north wind blowing across the mediterranean gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland rafah and alexandria are the wettest places in egypt the other wettest places are rosetta baltim kafr el dawwar and mersa matruh the city s climate is influenced by the mediterranean sea moderating its temperatures causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot summers that at times can be very humid january and february are the coolest months with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from and minimum temperatures that could reach alexandria experiences violent storms rain and sometimes snow sleet and hail during the cooler months these events combined with a poor drainage system have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city july and august are the hottest and driest months of the year with an average daily maximum temperature of the average annual rainfall is around but has been as high as port said kosseir baltim damietta and alexandria have the least temperature variation in egypt the highest recorded temperature was on may and the coldest recorded temperature was on january due to the constant presence of war in alexandria in ancient times very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour due to earthquake subsidence in ad and the rest has been built over in modern times pompey s pillar a roman triumphal column is one of the best known ancient monuments still standing in alexandria today it is located on alexandria s ancient acropolis a modest hill located adjacent to the city s arab cemetery and was originally part of a temple colonnade including its pedestal it is m ft high the shaft is of polished red granite in diameter at the base tapering to at the top the shaft is high and made out of a single piece of granite its volume is and weight approximately tons pompey s pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks the romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy roger hopkins and mark lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a ton obelisk in this followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a ton obelisk the structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that paganism must be eradicated pompey s pillar is a misnomer as it has nothing to do with pompey having been erected in for diocletian possibly in memory of the rebellion of domitius domitianus beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the serapeum where the mysteries of the god serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient library in more recent years many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea mostly pieces of old pottery alexandria s catacombs known as kom el shoqafa are a short distance southwest of the pillar consist of a multi level labyrinth reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars statues and other syncretic romano egyptian religious symbols burial niches and sarcophagi as well as a large roman style banquet room where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased the catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in the most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in alexandria is known as kom el deka it has revealed the ancient city s well preserved theater and the remains of its roman era baths persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of alexandria encouragement and help have been given by the local archaeological society and by many individuals notably greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history excavations were performed in the city by greeks seeking the tomb of alexander the great without success the past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered d g hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the egypt exploration fund and the society for the promotion of hellenic studies in and a german expedition worked for two years but two difficulties face the would be excavator in alexandria lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig except at enormous cost cleopatra vii s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century ad this underwater section containing many of the most interesting sections of the hellenistic city including the palace quarter was explored in and is still being extensively investigated by the french underwater archaeologist franck goddio and his team it raised a noted head of caesarion these are being opened up to tourists to some controversy the spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest where it is practically impossible to get below the roman strata the most important results were those achieved by dr g botti late director of the museum in the neighborhood of pompey s pillar where there is a good deal of open ground here substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed which are perhaps part of the serapeum nearby immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple these contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs now artificially lit and open to visitors the objects found in these researches are in the museum the most notable being a great basalt bull probably once an object of cult in the serapeum other catacombs and tombs have been opened in kom el shoqafa roman and ras el tin painted the german excavation team found remains of a ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north east of the city but little else hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of kom el deka which may have been part of the paneum the mausolea or a roman fortress the making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the patriarchal church and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered the wealth underground is doubtlessly immense but despite all efforts there is not much for antiquarians to see in alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of pompey s pillar the temple was built in the ptolemy era and dedicated to osiris which finished the construction of alexandria it is located in abusir the western suburb of alexandria in borg el arab city only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple there is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple remains of a christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries also

 johannesburg johannesburg also known as jozi joburg and egoli is the largest city in south africa and one of the largest urban areas in the world it is the provincial capital and largest city of gauteng which is the wealthiest province in south africa while johannesburg is not one of south africa s three capital cities it is the seat of the constitutional court the city is located in the mineral rich witwatersrand range of hills and is the centre of large scale gold and diamond trade the metropolis is an alpha global city as listed by the globalization and world cities research network in the population of the city of johannesburg was making it the most populous city in south africa in the same year the population of johannesburg s urban agglomeration was put at the land area of the municipal city is large in comparison with those of other major cities resulting in a moderate population density of the city was established in following the discovery of gold on what had been a farm the city is commonly interpreted as the modern day el dorado due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the witwatersrand the name is attributed to one or all of three men involved in the establishment of the city in ten years the population grew to inhabitants a separate city from the late 1970s until soweto is now part of johannesburg originally an acronym for south western townships soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of johannesburg populated mostly by native african workers from the gold mining industry soweto although eventually incorporated into johannesburg had been separated as a residential area for blacks who were not permitted to live in johannesburg proper lenasia is predominantly populated by english speaking south africans of indian descent these areas were designated as non white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the south african government known as apartheid controversy surrounds the origin of the name there were quite a number of people with the name johannes who were involved in the early history of the city among them are the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor general hendrik dercksen christiaan johannes joubert who was a member of the volksraad and was republic s chief of mining another was stephanus johannes paulus kruger better known as paul kruger president of the south african republic zar from johannes meyer the first government official in the area is another possibility precise records for the choice of name were lost johannes rissik and johannes joubert were members of a delegation sent to england to attain mining rights for the area joubert had a park in the city named after him and rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated rissik street post office is located the city hall is also located on rissik street the region surrounding johannesburg was originally inhabited by san people by the 13th century groups of bantu speaking people started moving southwards from central africa and encroached on the indigenous san population by the mid 18th century the broader region was largely settled by various sotho tswana communities one linguistic branch of bantu speakers whose villages towns chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now botswana in the west to present day lesotho in the south to the present day pedi areas of the northern province more specifically the stone walled ruins of sotho tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former transvaal province in which johannesburg is situated the sotho tswana practised farming and extensively mined and smelted metals that were available in the area moreover from the early 1960s until his retirement professor revil mason of the university of the witwatersrand explored and documented many late iron age archaeological sites throughout the johannesburg area these sites dated from between the 12th century and 18th century and many contained the ruins of sotho tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of europeans or the discovery of gold the most prominent site within johannesburg is melville koppies which contains an iron smelting furnace many sotho tswana towns and villages in the areas around johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from zululand during the late 18th and early 19th centuries the mfecane or difaqane wars and as a result an offshoot of the zulu kingdom the ndebele often referred to as the matabele the name given them by the local sotho tswana set up a kingdom to the northwest of johannesburg around modern day rustenburg the main witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in june on the farm vogelstruisfontein by jan gerritse bantjes that triggered the witwatersrand gold rush and the start of johannesburg in the discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area johann and johannes were common male names among the dutch of that time two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city christian johannes joubert and johann rissik are considered the source of the name by some johannes meyer the first government official in the area is another possibility precise records for the choice of name were lost within ten years the city of johannesburg included people in september the struben brothers discovered the confidence reef on the farm wilgespruit near present day roodepoort which further boosted excitement over gold prospects the first gold to be crushed on the witwatersrand was the gold bearing rock from the bantjes mine crushed using the struben brothers stamp machine also news of the discovery soon reached kimberley and directors cecil rhodes with sir joseph robinson rode up to investigate rumours for themselves they were guided to the bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with bantjes for two nights in they purchased the first pure refined gold from bantjes for incidentally bantjes had since been operating the kromdraai gold mine in the cradle of humankind together with his partner johannes stephanus minnaar where they first discovered gold in and which also offered another kind of discovery the early ancestors of all mankind some report australian george harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became johannesburg as he found gold on a farm in july he did not stay in the area gold was earlier discovered some to the east of present day johannesburg in barberton gold prospectors soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the witwatersrand offered by bantjes the original miners camp under the informal leadership of col ignatius ferreira was located in the fordsburg dip possibly because water was available there and because of the site s proximity to the diggings following upon the establishment of johannesburg the area was taken over by the government who had it surveyed and named it ferreira s township today the suburb of ferreirasdorp the first settlement at ferreira s camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of by the government took over the camp surveyed it and named it ferreira s township by johannesburg was established as a city of over inhabitants one of the fastest growth cities ever mines near johannesburg are among the deepest in the world with some as deep as 4000m like many late 19th century mining towns johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place populated by white miners from all continents african tribesmen recruited to perform unskilled mine work african women beer brewers who cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers a very large number of european prostitutes gangsters impoverished afrikaners tradesmen and zulu amawasha zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work as the value of control of the land increased tensions developed between the boer government in pretoria and the british culminating in the jameson raid that ended in fiasco at doornkop in january and the second boer war that saw british forces under field marshal frederick sleigh roberts 1st earl roberts occupy the city on may after a series of battles to the south west of its then limits near present day krugersdorp fighting took place at the gatsrand pass near zakariyya park on may north of vanwyksrust today s nancefield eldorado park and naturena the next day culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in chiawelo and senaoane on may during the war many african mineworkers left johannesburg creating a labour shortage which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from china especially southern china after the war they were replaced by black workers but many chinese stayed on creating johannesburg s chinese community which during the apartheid era was not legally classified as asian but as coloured the population in was of whom were whites major building developments took place in the 1930s after south africa went off the gold standard in the late 1940s and early 1950s hillbrow went high rise in the 1950s and early 1960s the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as soweto new freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city in the late 1960s and early 1970s tower blocks including the carlton centre and the southern life centre filled the skyline of the central business district the central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls decentralised office parks and entertainment centres sandton city was opened in followed by rosebank mall in and eastgate in on may a series of riots started in the township of alexandra in the north eastern part of johannesburg when locals attacked migrants from mozambique malawi and zimbabwe killing two people and injuring others these riots sparked the xenophobic attacks of a completely refurbished soccer city stadium in johannesburg hosted the fifa world cup final the redevelopment of newtown was inevitable and part of the reason why the city and heritage bodies decided to keep the fa√ßades of the old buildings and apportion new meaning to it was because part of the identity of the area was forged in the old buildings it was known throughout its redevelopment as the newtown cultural precinct it was therefore important to stage old renovated buildings as the setting of the new precinct demolishing the old structures and replacing them with new buildings would not have achieved the same effect everyone played their part in the marketing branding and the new identity of the precinct the city heritage bodies heritage practitioners private companies all played a part the old warehouse industrial buildings that once lay decaying in newtown are now synonymous with culture and flair the 1930s industrial architecture has been transformed into classy boutiques and restaurants that are patronised by the middle to upper class residents and workers of the filming studios and offices that surround the area the precinct has proved to be a popular centre and developers are interested to expand the area and connect it to the cbd johannesburg gas works a huge property of 14ha lies vacant and has been targeted for development like many cities around the world there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of johannesburg one of these initiatives is the maboneng district located in the south eastern side of the cbd originally a hub for art it has expanded to include restaurants entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels maboneng calls itself a place of inspiration a creative hub a place to do business a destination for visitors and a safe integrated community for residents a beacon of strength in africa s most economically prosperous city after being destroyed in to make way for a motor showroom by imperial holdings the iconic rand steam laundries are now being redeveloped as an exact replica by the order of the johannesburg heritage council apart from one filtration shed there is nothing left on the site after being destroyed the site will consist of a 5100m¬≤ precinct johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of south africa known as the highveld at an elevation of the former central business district is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the witwatersrand afrikaans white water s ridge and the terrain falls to the north and south by and large the witwatersrand marks the watershed between the limpopo and vaal rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the jukskei river while the southern part of the city including most of the central business district is drained by the klip river the north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour but its streams contribute to two of southern africa s mightiest rivers the limpopo and the orange most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with fontein meaning spring in afrikaans braamfontein rietfontein zevenfontein doornfontein zandfontein and randjesfontein are some examples when the first white settlers reached the area that is now johannesburg they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges running with trickles of water fed by the streams giving the area its name the witwatersrand the ridge of white waters another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock which has a particular sheen to it after rain the site was not chosen solely for its streams however one of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold indeed the city once sat near massive amounts of gold given that at one point the witwatersrand gold industry produced forty percent of the planet s gold johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau and has a subtropical highland climate k√∂ppen cwb the city enjoys a sunny climate with the summer months october to april characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings and the winter months may to september by dry sunny days followed by cold nights temperatures in johannesburg are usually fairly mild

race in melbourne acquired its first public monument the burke and wills statue with the gold rush largely over by melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of victoria especially wool and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs an extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late 1850s construction started on further major public buildings in the 1860s and 1870s such as the supreme court government house and the queen victoria market the central city filled up with shops and offices workshops and warehouses large banks and hotels faced the main streets with fine townhouses in the east end of collins street contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks the aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated total decrease by due primarily to introduced diseases particularly smallpox frontier violence and dispossession of their lands the decade of the 1880s was one of extraordinary growth when consumer confidence easy access to credit and steep increases in the price of land led to an enormous amount of construction this land boom was followed by a severe economic crash in the early 1890s which lasted until the end of the century during the boom melbourne had reputedly become the richest city in the world and the largest after london in the british empire the decade began with the melbourne international exhibition in held in the large purpose built exhibition building in a telephone exchange was established and in the same year the foundations of st paul s were laid in electric light was installed in the eastern market and in the following year a generating station capable of supplying incandescent lamps was in operation in the first line of the melbourne cable tramway system was built becoming one of the world s most extensive systems by during a visit in english journalist george augustus henry sala coined the phrase marvellous melbourne which stuck long into the twentieth century and is still used today by melburnians growing building activity culminated in a land boom which in reached a peak of speculative development fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value as a result of the boom large commercial buildings coffee palaces terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city the establishment of a hydraulic facility in allowed for the local manufacture of elevators resulting in the first construction of high rise buildings most notably the apa building amongst the world s tallest commercial buildings upon completion in this period also saw the expansion of a major radial rail based transport network in the exhibition building hosted a second event even larger than the first the melbourne centennial exhibition spurring construction of numerous hotels including the room federal hotel the palace hotel in bourke street both since demolished and the doubling in size of the grand windsor a brash boosterism that had typified melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe depression of the city s economy sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos during which small land banks and building societies collapsed and limited companies went into liquidation the melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the australian economic depression of the 1890s and the australian banking crisis of the effects of the depression on the city were profound with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s at the time of australia s federation on january melbourne became the seat of government of the federation the first federal parliament was convened on may in the royal exhibition building subsequently moving to the victorian parliament house where it was located until when it was moved to canberra the governor general of australia resided at government house in melbourne until and many major national institutions remained in melbourne well into the twentieth century in the immediate years after world war ii melbourne expanded rapidly its growth boosted by post war immigration to australia primarily from southern europe and the mediterranean while the paris end of collins street began melbourne s boutique shopping and open air cafe cultures the city centre was seen by many as stale the dreary domain of office workers something expressed by john brack in his famous painting collins st pm height limits in the melbourne cbd were lifted in after the construction of ici house transforming the city s skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers suburban expansion then intensified served by new indoor malls beginning with chadstone shopping centre the post war period also saw a major renewal of the cbd and st kilda road which significantly modernised the city new fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre war cbd buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided to counter the trend towards low density suburban residential growth the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the housing commission of victoria which resulted in demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high rise towers in later years with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner city population the bolte government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of melbourne major road projects including the remodelling of st kilda junction the widening of hoddle street and then the extensive melbourne transportation plan changed the face of the city into a car dominated environment australia s financial and mining booms during and resulted in establishment of the headquarters of many major companies bhp billiton and rio tinto among others in the city nauru s then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in melbourne such as nauru house melbourne remained australia s main business and financial centre until the late 1970s when it began to lose this primacy to sydney melbourne experienced an economic downturn between and following the collapse of several local financial institutions in the newly elected kennett government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism during this period the australian grand prix moved to melbourne from adelaide major projects included the construction of a new facility for the melbourne museum federation square the melbourne exhibition and convention centre crown casino and the citylink tollway other strategies included the privatisation of some of melbourne s services including power and public transport and a reduction in funding to public services such as health education and public transport infrastructure since the mid 1990s melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth there has been substantial international investment in the city s industries and property market major inner city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as southbank port melbourne melbourne docklands and more recently south wharf according to the australian bureau of statistics melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any australian capital city in the three years ended june these factors have led to population growth and further suburban expansion through the 2000s from the growth of the city extended into green wedges and beyond the city s urban growth boundary predictions of the city s population reaching million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in as part of its melbourne five million strategy in melbourne was less affected by the late 2000s financial crisis in comparison to other australian cities at this time more new jobs were created in melbourne than any other australian city almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities brisbane and perth combined and melbourne s property market remained highly priced resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases melbourne is in the southeastern part of mainland australia within the state of

melbourne has a temperate oceanic climate k√∂ppen climate classification cfb with warm summers and cool winters melbourne is well known for its changeable weather conditions mainly due to its location situated on the boundary of the very hot inland areas and the cool southern ocean this temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause very strong cold fronts to form these cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from gales to severe thunderstorms and hail large temperature drops and heavy rain winters however are usually very stable but rather damp and often cloudy port phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and or the land mass particularly in spring and autumn this can set up a bay effect similar to the lake effect seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places usually the eastern suburbs for an extended period while the rest of melbourne and surrounds stays dry overall melbourne is owing to the rain shadow of the otway ranges nonetheless drier than average for southern victoria within the city and surrounds rainfall varies widely from around at little river to on the eastern fringe at gembrook melbourne receives clear days annually dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from to melbourne is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a cold pool crosses the state especially if there is considerable daytime heating these showers are often heavy and can include hail squalls and significant drops in temperature but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower this can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day giving melbourne a reputation for having four seasons in one day a phrase that is part of local popular culture the lowest temperature on record is on july the highest temperature recorded in melbourne city was on february while snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city it has not been recorded in the central business district since the average temperature of the sea ranges from in september to in february at port melbourne the average sea temperature range is the same melbourne s air quality is generally good and has improved significantly since the 1980s like many urban areas the city faces significant environmental issues many related to the city s large urban footprint and urban sprawl and the demand for infrastructure and services one such issue is the impact of drought on water supply periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete melbourne s water supplies and climate change may exacerbate the long term impact of these factors during the millennium drought the bracks government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling incentives for household water tanks greywater systems water consumption awareness initiatives and other water saving and reuse initiatives but as water storages continued to fall further measures were required in june the bracks government announced the construction of the billion wonthaggi desalination plant and the so called north south pipeline from the goulburn valley in victoria s north to melbourne neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during and therefore both have been criticised as white elephants in response to attribution of recent climate change in the city of melbourne set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by and moreland city council established the zero moreland program not all metropolitan municipalities have followed suit with the city of glen eira notably deciding in not to become carbon neutral melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing resulting in a vast suburban sprawl with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas much of the vegetation within the city is non native species most of european origin including many invasive species and noxious weeds significant introduced urban pests include the common myna feral pigeon brown rat european wasp common starling and red fox many outlying suburbs particularly towards the yarra valley and the hills to the northeast and east have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland the department of sustainability and environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off several national parks have been designated around the urban area of melbourne including the mornington peninsula national park port phillip heads marine national park and point nepean national park in the southeast organ pipes national park to the north and dandenong ranges national park to the east there are also a number of significant state parks just outside melbourne responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the epa victoria and several local councils air pollution by world standards is classified as good summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area another recent environmental issue in melbourne was the victorian government project of channel deepening melbourne ports by dredging port phillip bay the port phillip channel deepening project it was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments other major pollution problems in melbourne include levels of bacteria including e coli in the yarra river and its tributaries caused by septic systems as well as litter up to cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution in february the transition decade an initiative to transition human society economics and environment toward sustainability was launched in melbourne the hoddle grid dimensions of forms the centre of melbourne s central business district the grid s southern edge fronts onto the yarra river office commercial and public

prominent lanes and arcades most notably block place and royal arcade which contain a variety of shops and caf√©s and are a byproduct of the city s layout melbourne s cbd compared with other australian cities has comparatively unrestricted height limits and as a result of waves of post war development contains five of the seven tallest buildings in australia the tallest of which is the eureka tower situated in southbank it has an observation deck on the 88th floor the rialto tower the city s second tallest remains the tallest building in the old cbd its observation deck closed on december the cbd and surrounds also contain many significant historic buildings such as the royal exhibition building the melbourne town hall and parliament house although the area is described as the centre it is not actually the demographic centre of melbourne at all due to an urban sprawl to the south east the demographic centre being located at glen iris melbourne is typical of australian capital cities in that after the turn of the 20th century it expanded with the underlying notion of a quarter acre home and garden for every family often referred to locally as the australian dream

hippie trail in the early 1970s radio kabul began to broadcast in other languages besides pashto which helped to unify those minorities that often felt marginalized however this was put to a stop after daoud khan the king s cousin and former prime minister launched a coup in july which deposed the king and took over power this was supported by the people s democratic party of afghanistan pdpa a pro soviet political party daoud named himself president and planned to institute reforms the bbc has described the period before the april revolution as an era when the ethnic groups of afghanistan lived together harmoniously intermarried and mixed socially on april president daoud and most of his family were assassinated in kabul in what is called the saur revolution pro soviet pdpa under nur muhammad taraki seized power and slowly began to institute reforms private businesses were nationalized in the soviet manner education was modified into the soviet model with lessons focusing on teaching russian marxism leninism and learning of other countries belonging to the soviet bloc foreign backed rebel groups and army deserters took up arms in the name of islam in february u s ambassador adolph dubs was murdered after afghan security forces burst in on his kidnappers in september afghan president taraki was assassinated by his rival hafizullah amin who in turn was

this invasion pakistani president zia ul haq chaired a meeting in islamabad and was told by several cabinet members to refrain from interfering in afghanistan owing to the vastly superior military power of the soviet union however zia ul haq fearing that the soviets would next invade pakistan particularly into balochistan province for access to the warm waters of the arabian sea made no secret about his intentions of aiding the mujahideen rebel groups during this meeting director general of the isi akhtar abdur rahman advocated for the idea of covert operation in afghanistan by arming islamic extremists who formed the mujahideen general rahman was heard loudly saying kabul must burn kabul must burn and mastered the idea of proxy war in afghanistan president zia ul haq authorised this operation under general rahman which was later merged with operation cyclone a programme funded by the united states and carried out by the central intelligence agency large protests against the soviet presence broke out in kabul in in what is called the hut uprising the soviets turned the city of kabul into their command center during the soviet afghan war kabul was considered moderately safe during that period as it was essentially a guerrilla war with fighting mostly taking place in the countryside during this time women made up of the workforce however political crime such as assassinations of pdpa party members or guerrilla attacks on military and government targets were quite common the soviet embassy for example was attacked four times with arms fire in the first five years of the war in a report from izvestia said that most public places such as hospitals and state banks had people with guns in their hands which was not the case before a western correspondent revisiting kabul in december after a year said that the city was converted into a fortress bristling with weapons contrastingly american diplomat charles dunbar said that the soviet troops presence was surprisingly modest he said in a july article that whilst soviet troops are a common sight they do not give the impression of invaders who are enforcing their occupation at the point of a bayonet soviet men and women were very common in the city s shopping roads with the large availability of western products an december article from bulletin of the atomic scientists where the author stayed two weeks in the city said that the soviet soldiers had a friendly atmosphere in which they would greet friends and have a chat with the population most soviet civilians numbering between and lived in

revolution a truck bomb killed six people the city s population increased from around in to million in the large influx were mostly internal refugees who fled other parts of the country for safety in kabul after the fall of najibullah s government in april leaders of the different mujahideen factions created a new government under the peshawar accords but gulbuddin hekmatyar s party refused to sign the accords and started shelling the city for power which soon escalated into a full scale conflict this marked the start of a dark period of the city at least civilians were killed in a period known locally as the kabul wars about percent of the city was devastated and destroyed by the old city and western areas were among the worst hit a the new york times analyst said in that the city was more devastated than sarajevo which was similarly damaged during the bosnian war at the time the city suffered heavily under a bombardment campaign between rival militias which intensified during the summer of its geographic location in a narrow valley made it an easy target from rockets fired by militias who based themselves in the surrounding mountains initially the factions in the city aligned to fight off hekmatyar s forces but diplomacy inside the capital quickly broke down for the following two years in particular much of kabul would be laid to waste the majority of infrastructure destroyed a massive exodus of the population leaving to the countryside or abroad and electricity and water completely out in late bombardment of the capital came to a temporary halt these forces took steps to restore law and order courts started to work again convicting individuals inside government troops who had committed crimes on september when the taliban prepared a major offensive ahmad shah

monument symbols of the city madrid is the most visited city of spain majrƒ´·π≠ afi is the first documented reference to the city it is recorded in andalusi arabic during the al andalus period the name magerit was retained in medieval spanish the most ancient recorded name of the city magerit for materit or mageterit comes from the name of a fortress built on the manzanares river in the 9th century ad and means place of abundant water in arabic a wider number of theories have been formulated on possible earlier origins according to legend madrid was founded by ocno bianor son of king tyrrhenius of tuscany and mantua and was named metragirta or mantua carpetana others contend that the original name of the city was ursaria land of bears in latin because of the many bears that were to be found in the nearby forests which together with the strawberry tree spanish madro√±o have been the emblem of the city since the middle ages nevertheless it is also speculated that the origin of the current name of the city comes from the 2nd century bc the roman empire established a settlement on the banks of the manzanares river the name of this first village was matrice a reference to the river that crossed the settlement following the invasions carried out by the germanic sueves and vandals as well as the sarmatic alans during the 5th century ad the roman empire no longer had the military presence required to defend its territories on the iberian peninsula and as a consequence these territories were soon occupied by the vandals who were in turn dispelled by the visigoths who then ruled hispania in the name of the roman emperor also taking control of matrice in the 8th century the islamic conquest of the iberian peninsula saw the name changed to mayrit from the arabic term mayra referencing water as a tree or giver of life and the ibero roman suffix it that means place the modern madrid evolved from the mozarabic matrit which is still in the madrilenian gentilic although the site of modern day madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times and there are archaeological remains of carpetani settlement roman villas a visigoth basilica near the church of santa mar√≠a de la almudena and three visigoth necropoleis near casa de campo tet√∫an and vic√°lvaro the first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in madrid dates from the muslim age at the second half of the 9th century emir muhammad i of c√≥rdoba built a fortress on a headland near the river manzanares as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between al andalus and the kingdoms of le√≥n and castile with the objective of protecting toledo from the christian invasions and also as a starting point for muslim offensives after the disintegration of the caliphate of c√≥rdoba madrid was integrated in the taifa of toledo with the surrender of toledo to alfonso vi of le√≥n and castile the city was conquered by christians in and it was integrated into the kingdom of castile as a property of the crown christians replaced muslims in the occupation of the centre of the city while muslims and jews settled in the suburbs the city was thriving and was given the title of villa whose administrative district extended from the jarama in the east to the river guadarrama in the west the government of the town was vested to the neighbouring of madrid since when king alfonso xi of castile implements the regiment for which only the local oligarchy was taking sides in city decisions since madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of castile in king alfonso viii of castile gave madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council which was expanded in by ferdinand iii of castile in the courts of castile were joined in madrid for the first time under ferdinand iv of castile and later in and twice in since the unification of the kingdoms of spain under a common crown the courts were convened in madrid more often during the revolt of the comuneros led by juan de padilla madrid joined the revolt against emperor charles v of germany and i of spain but after defeat at the battle of villalar madrid was besieged and occupied by the royal troops however charles i was generous to the town and gave it the titles of coronada crowned and imperial when francis i of france was captured at the battle of pavia he was imprisoned in madrid and in the village is dated the treaty of madrid of later denounced by the french that resolved their situation is seen in the foreground the banks of the

palacio real the following churches are seen in the village from left to right san gil san juan santiago san salvador iglesia de san miguel de los octoes san nicol√°s santa mar√≠a san justo san pedro capilla del obispo san andr√©s and outside the walls san francisco that do not yet have even the profile of domes and chapiters by which they would be characterised in the following centuries outside the walls and on the river there is a craft facility dedicated to the treatment of hides the pozacho tanneries the recent installation of the court imposed a regal√≠a de aposento tax on private houses which produced all kinds of resistance including most notably the construction of casas a la malicia the number of urban inhabitants grew from in the year to in the year the poor population of the court was composed of ex soldiers foreigners rogues and ruanes dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices in june when the town had inhabitants philip ii of spain moved his court from valladolid to madrid installing it in the old castle thanks to this the city of madrid became the political centre of the monarchy being the capital of spain except for a short period between and philip iii of spain s government in which the court returned to valladolid this fact was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate during the reign of philip iii and philip iv of spain madrid saw a period of exceptional cultural brilliance with the presence of geniuses such as miguel de cervantes diego vel√°zquez francisco de quevedo and lope de vega the death of charles ii of spain resulted in the war of the spanish succession the city supported the claim of philip of anjou as philip v while the city was occupied in by a portuguese army who proclaimed king the archduke charles of austria under the name of charles iii and again in remained loyal to philip v philip v built the royal palace the royal tapestry factory and the main royal academies but the most important bourbon was king charles iii of spain who was known as the best mayor of madrid charles iii took upon himself the feat of transforming madrid into a capital worthy of this category he ordered the construction of sewers street lighting cemeteries outside the city and many monuments puerta de alcal√° cibeles fountain and cultural institutions el prado museum royal botanic gardens royal observatory etc despite being known as one of the greatest benefactors of madrid his beginnings were not entirely peaceful as in he had to overcome the esquilache riots a traditionalist revolt instigated by the nobility and clergy against his reformist intentions demanding the repeal of the clothing decree ordering the shortening of the layers and the prohibition of the use of hats that hide the face with the aim of reducing crime in the city the reign of charles iv of spain is not very meaningful to madrid except for the presence of goya in the court who portrayed the popular and courtly life of the city on october charles iv and napoleon i signed the treaty of fontainebleau which allowed the passage of french troops through spanish territory to join the spanish troops and invade portugal which had refused to obey the order of international blockade against england as this was happening there was the mutiny of aranjuez march by which the crown prince ferdinand vii replaced his father as king however when ferdinand vii returned to madrid the city was already occupied by joachim napol√©on murat so that both the king and his father were virtually prisoners of the french army napoleon taking advantage of the weakness of the spanish bourbons forced both first the father then the son to join him in bayonne where ferdinand arrived on april in the absence of the two kings the situation became more and more tense in the capital on may a crowd began to gather at the royal palace the crowd saw the french soldiers pulled out of the palace to the royal family members who were still in the palace immediately the crowd launched an assault on the floats the fight lasted hours and spread throughout madrid subsequent repression was brutal in the paseo del prado and in the fields of la moncloa hundreds of patriots were shot due to murat s order against spanish all carrying arms paintings such as the third of may by goya reflect the repression that ended the

frequently altered by revolutionary outbreaks and pronouncements such as vic√°lvaro led by general leopoldo o donnell and initiating the progressive biennium however in the early 20th century madrid

zikwala and menegasha on a map drawn by the italian cartographer fra mauro in around and it was razed and plundered by ahmed gragn while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the awash river in an event witnessed and documented two years later by the yemeni writer arab faqih the suggestion that barara was located on mount entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking addis ababa located between rock hewn washa mikael and the more modern church of entoto maryam founded in the late 19th century by emperor menelik dubbed the pentagon the hectare site incorporates a castle with towers along with meters of stone walls measuring up to meter high the site of addis ababa was chosen by empress taytu betul and the city was founded in by

medieval town and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of the medieval empire s capital in the area before the campaigns of ahmad ibn ibrihim his interest in the area grew when his wife taytu began work on a church on mount entoto and menelik endowed a second church in the area however the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of firewood and water so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in initially taytu built a house for herself near the filwoha hot mineral springs where she and members of the showan royal court liked to take mineral baths other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity and menelik expanded his wife s house to become the imperial palace which remains the seat of government in addis

southeastern coast buenos aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century by the use of the original name real de nuestra se√±ora santa mar√≠a del buen ayre the greater buenos aires conurbation which also includes several buenos aires province districts constitutes the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the americas with a population of around million the city of buenos aires is neither part of buenos aires province nor the province s capital rather it is an autonomous district in after decades of political infighting buenos aires was federalized and removed from buenos aires province the city limits were enlarged to include the towns of belgrano and flores both are now neighborhoods of the city the constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy hence its formal name autonomous city of buenos aires ciudad aut√≥noma de buenos aires caba its citizens first elected a chief of government

cup buenos aires will host the summer youth olympics and the g20 summit buenos aires is a multicultural city being home to multiple ethnic and religious groups several languages are spoken in the city in addition to spanish contributing to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country this is because in the last years the city and the country in general has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world making it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together and being considered as one of the most diverse cities of the americas it is recorded under the archives of aragonese that catalan missionaries and jesuits arriving in cagliari sardinia under the crown of aragon after its capture from the pisans in established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city the hill was known to them as bonaira or bonaria in sardinian language as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city the castle area which is adjacent to swampland during the siege of cagliari the catalans built a sanctuary to the virgin mary on top of the hill in king alfonso the gentle donated the church to the mercedarians who built an abbey that stands to this day in the years after that a story circulated claiming that a statue of the virgin mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the mediterranean sea the statue was placed in the abbey spanish sailors especially andalusians venerated this image and frequently invoked the fair winds to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks a sanctuary to the virgin of buen ayre would be later erected in seville in the first foundation of buenos aires spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the r√≠o de la plata by the blessings of the santa maria de los buenos aires the holy virgin mary of the good winds who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of buenos aires pedro de mendoza called the city holy mary of the fair winds a name suggested by the chaplain of mendoza s expedition a devotee of the virgin of buen ayre after the sardinian madonna de bonaria that is still to this day the patroness of sardinia mendoza s settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people and was abandoned in for many years the name was attributed to a sancho del campo who is said to have exclaimed how fair are the winds of this land as he arrived but eduardo madero in after conducting extensive research in spanish archives ultimately concluded that the name was indeed closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to our lady of buen ayre a second and permanent settlement was established in by juan de garay who sailed down the paran√° river from asunci√≥n now the capital of paraguay garay preserved the name originally chosen by mendoza calling the city ciudad de la sant√≠sima trinidad y puerto de santa mar√≠a del buen aire city of the most holy trinity and port of saint mary of the fair winds the short form buenos aires became the common usage during the 17th century the usual abbreviation for buenos aires in spanish is bs as it is common as well to refer to it as b a or ba while ba is used more by expats residing in the city the locals more often use the abbreviation baires in one word seaman juan d√≠az de sol√≠s navigating in the name of spain was the first european to reach the r√≠o de la plata in his expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native charr√∫a tribe in what is now uruguay the city of buenos aires was first established as ciudad de nuestra se√±ora santa mar√≠a del buen ayre literally city of our lady saint mary of the fair winds after our lady of bonaria patroness saint of sardinia on february by a spanish expedition led by pedro de mendoza the settlement founded by mendoza was located in what is today the san telmo district of buenos aires south of the city centre more attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away and in the site was abandoned a second and permanent settlement was established on june by juan de garay who arrived by sailing down the paran√° river from asunci√≥n now the capital of paraguay he dubbed the settlement sant√≠sima trinidad and its port became puerto de santa mar√≠a de los buenos aires from its earliest days buenos aires depended primarily on trade during most of the 17th century spanish ships were menaced by pirates so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to central america in a convoy from seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies to lima peru and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty because of this products took a very long time to arrive in buenos aires and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive this scheme frustrated the traders of buenos aires and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the portuguese this also instilled a deep resentment among porte√±os towards the spanish authorities sensing these feelings charles iii of spain progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared buenos aires an open port in the late 18th century the capture of porto bello by british forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the atlantic route to the detriment of lima based trade one of his rulings was to split a region from the viceroyalty of per√∫ and create instead the viceroyalty of the r√≠o de la plata with buenos aires as the capital however charles s placating actions did not have the desired effect and the porte√±os some of them versed in the ideology of the french revolution became even more convinced of the need for independence from spain during the british invasions of the r√≠o de la plata british forces attacked buenos aires twice in the british successfully invaded buenos aires but an army from montevideo led by santiago de liniers defeated them in the brief period of british rule the viceroy rafael sobremonte managed to escape to c√≥rdoba and designated this city as capital buenos aires became the capital again after its liberation but sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy santiago de liniers chosen as new viceroy prepared the city against a possible new british attack and repelled the attempted invasion of the militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos in contrast to peninsulars as well as the development of the peninsular war in spain an attempt by the peninsular merchant mart√≠n de √°lzaga to remove liniers and replace him with a junta was defeated by the criollo armies however by it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt successfully removing the new viceroy baltasar hidalgo de cisneros this is known as the may revolution which is now celebrated as a national holiday this event started the argentine war of independence and many armies left buenos aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance with varying levels of success the government was held first by two juntas of many members then by two triumvirates and finally by a unipersonal office the supreme director formal independence from spain was declared in at the congress of tucum√°n buenos aires managed to endure the whole spanish american wars of independence without falling again under royalist rule historically buenos aires has been argentina s main venue of liberal free trading and foreign ideas while many of the provinces especially those to the north west advocated a more nationalistic and catholic approach to political and social issues much of the internal tension in argentina s history starting with the centralist federalist conflicts of the 19th century can be traced back to these contrasting views in the months immediately following the may revolution buenos aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval many of these missions ended in violent clashes and the enterprise fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces in the 19th century the city was blockaded twice by naval forces by the french from to and later by an anglo french expedition from to both blockades failed to force the city into submission and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands during most of the 19th century the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject it was already the capital of buenos aires province and between and it was the capital of the seceded state of buenos aires the issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield until the matter was finally settled in when the city was federalized and became the seat of government with its mayor appointed by the president the casa rosada became the seat of the president health conditions in poor areas were negative with high rates of tuberculosis public health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses conventillos for the spread of the dreaded disease people ignored public health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones in addition to the wealth generated by the buenos aires customs and the fertile pampas railroad development in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of buenos aires as raw materials flowed into its factories a leading destination for immigrants from europe particularly italy and spain from to buenos aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major european capitals the col√≥n theater became one of the world s top opera venues and the city became the regional capital of radio television cinema and theatre the city s main avenues were built during those years and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of south america s tallest buildings and its first underground system a second construction boom from to reshaped downtown and much of the city buenos aires also attracted migrants from argentina s provinces and neighboring countries shanty towns villas miseria started growing around the city s industrial areas during the 1930s leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly mobile buenos aires population these laborers became the political base of peronism which emerged in buenos aires during the pivotal demonstration of october at the plaza de mayo industrial workers of the greater buenos aires industrial belt have been peronism s main support base ever since and plaza de mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country s political events on june however a splinter faction of the navy bombed the plaza de mayo area killing civilians see bombing of plaza de mayo this was the only time the city was attacked from the air and the event was followed by a military uprising which

right wing paramilitary group triple a supported by isabel per√≥n who became president of argentina in after juan per√≥n s death the march coup led by general jorge videla only escalated this conflict the dirty war resulted in desaparecidos people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta the silent marches of their mothers mothers of the plaza de mayo are a well known image of argentines suffering during those times the dictatorship s appointed mayor osvaldo cacciatore also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city s acute traffic gridlock the plan however called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day the city was visited by pope john paul ii twice firstly in and again in on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city s history the return of democracy in coincided with a cultural revival and the 1990s saw an economic revival particularly in the construction and financial sectors on

integral to the growing primacy of buenos aires and the accompanying urban identity and established the division between urban and rural argentina more deeply immigrants brought new traditions and cultural markers to the city which were then reimagined in the porte√±o context with new layers of meanings because of the new location the heads of state s attempt to populate the country and reframe the national identity resulted in the concentration of immigrants in the city and its suburbs who generated a culture that is a product of their conflicts of integration their difficulties to live and their communication puzzles in response to the immigration wave during the 1920s and 1930s a nationalist trend within the argentine intellectual elite glorified the gaucho figure as an exemplary archetype of argentine culture its synthesis with the european traditions conformed the new urban identity of buenos aires the complexity of buenos aires integration and identity formation issues increased when immigrants realized that their european culture could help them gain a greater social status as the rural population moved to the industrialized city from the 1930s onwards they reaffirmed their european roots adopting endogamy and founding private schools newspapers in foreign languages and associations that promoted adherence to their countries of origin porte√±os are

feature that people from the americas and westerners in general commonly attribute to the entire argentine population and use as the subject of numerous jokes writing for bbc mundo cristina p√©rez felt that the idea of the argentines vastly developed ego finds strong evidence in lunfardo dictionaries in words such as engrupido meaning vain or conceited and compadrito meaning both brave and braggart the latter being an archetypal figure of tango paradoxically porte√±os are also described as highly self critical something that has been called the other side of the ego coin writers consider that these behaviours are the consequence of the european immigration and prosperity the city experienced during the early 20th century which generated a feeling of superiority in parts of the population buenos aires has a thriving arts culture with a huge inventory of museums ranging from obscure to world class the barrios of palermo and recoleta are the city s traditional bastions in the diffusion of art although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as puerto madero or la boca renowned venues include malba the

of political liberty in the country such as the sanction of the secret ballot and universal male suffrage the first president to be popularly elected and the cultural revolution that involved the university reform of in this context in which there continued to be influence from the paris school modigliani chagall soutine klee three main groups arose buenos aires has been the birthplace of several artists and movements of national and international relevance and has become a central motif in argentine artistic production specially since the 20th century examples include the paris group so named for being influenced by the school of paris constituted by antonio berni aquiles badi lino enea spilimbergo raquel forner and alfredo bigatti among others and the la boca artists including benito quinquela mart√≠n and alfredo lazzari among others who mostly came from italy or were of italian descent and usually painted scenes from this working class port neighbourhood during the 1960s the torcuato di tella institute located in florida street became a leading local center for pop art performance art installation art experimental theatre and conceptual art this generation of artists included marta minuj√≠n dalila puzzovio david lamelas and clorindo testa buenos aires has also become a prominent center of contemporary street art its welcoming attitude has made it one of the world s top capitals of such expression the city s turbulent modern political history has bred an intense sense of expression in porte√±os and urban art has been used to depict these stories and as a means of protest however not all of its street art concerns politics it is also used as a symbol of democracy and freedom of expression murals and graffiti are so common that they are considered an everyday occurrence and have become part of the urban landscape of barrios such as palermo villa urquiza coghlan and san telmo this has to do with the legality of such activities provided that the building owner has consented and the receptiveness of local authorities who even subsidize various works the abundance of places for urban artists to create their work and the relatively lax rules for street art have attracted international artists such as blu jef a√©rosol aryz roa and ron english guided tours to see murals and graffiti around the city have been growing steadily despite its short urban

poetry in particular according to carlos abreg√∫ virreyra by the lules jur√≠es diaguitas and tonocot√©s a symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and spanish traditions creating a distinct literature geographically limited well into the 18th century to the argentine north and central regions with the province of c√≥rdoba as its center due to the foundation of the national university of c√≥rdoba

20th century argentina absorbed millions of immigrants many of them italians who spoke mostly in their local dialects mainly neapolitan sicilian and genoese their adoption of spanish was gradual creating a pidgin of italian dialects and spanish that was called cocoliche its usage declined around the 1950s a phonetic study conducted by the laboratory for sensory investigations of conicet and the university of toronto showed that the prosody of porte√±o is closer to the neapolitan language of italy than to any other spoken language many spanish immigrants were from galicia and spaniards

suburban transportation in particular became all too apparent with the paris agglomeration s growth paul delouvrier promised to resolve the paris suburbs m√©sentente when he became head of the paris region in two of his most ambitious projects for the region were the construction of five suburban villes nouvelles new cities and the rer commuter train network many other suburban residential districts grands ensembles were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low cost solution for a rapidly expanding population these districts were socially mixed at first but few residents actually owned their homes the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities these areas quartiers sensibles sensitive quarters are in northern and eastern paris namely around its goutte d or and belleville neighbourhoods to the north of the city they are grouped mainly in the seine saint denis department and to a lesser extreme to the east in

amestelledamme people residing near amestelledamme by the name had developed into aemsterdam amsterdam is much younger than dutch cities such as nijmegen rotterdam and utrecht in october historical geographer chris de bont suggested that the land around amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century this does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since reclamation of land may not have been for farming it may have been for peat for use as fuel amsterdam was granted city rights in either or from the 14th century on amsterdam flourished largely from trade with the hanseatic league in an alleged eucharistic miracle in the kalverstraat rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the adoption of the protestant faith the miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive in the 19th century especially after the jubilee of the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for dutch catholics the stille omgang a silent walk or procession in civil attire is the expression of the pilgrimage within the protestant netherlands since the late 19th century in the heyday of the silent walk up to pilgrims came to amsterdam in the 21st century this has reduced to about in the 16th century the dutch rebelled against philip ii of spain and his successors the main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes the tenth penny and the religious persecution of protestants by the newly introduced inquisition the revolt escalated into the eighty years war which ultimately led to dutch independence strongly pushed by dutch revolt leader william the silent the dutch republic became known for its relative religious tolerance jews from the iberian peninsula huguenots from france prosperous merchants and printers from flanders and economic and religious refugees from the spanish controlled parts of the low countries found safety in amsterdam the influx of flemish printers and the city s intellectual tolerance made amsterdam a centre for the european free press the 17th century is considered amsterdam s golden age during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world ships sailed from amsterdam to the baltic sea north america and africa as well as present day indonesia india sri lanka and brazil forming the basis of a worldwide trading network amsterdam s merchants had the largest share in both the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company these companies acquired overseas possessions that later became dutch colonies amsterdam was europe s most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading financial centre of the western world in the amsterdam office of the international trading dutch east india company became the world s first stock exchange by trading in its own shares the bank of amsterdam started operations in acting as a full service bank for dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank amsterdam s prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries the wars of the dutch republic with england and france took their toll on amsterdam during the napoleonic wars amsterdam s significance reached its lowest point with holland being absorbed into the french empire however the later establishment of the united kingdom of the netherlands in marked a turning point the end of the 19th century is sometimes called amsterdam s second golden age new museums a railway station and the concertgebouw were built in this same time the industrial revolution reached the city the amsterdam rhine canal was dug to give amsterdam a direct connection to the rhine and the north sea canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the north sea both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of europe and the world in joseph conrad gave a brief description of amsterdam as seen from the seaside in the mirror of the sea shortly before the first world war the city started to expand again and new suburbs were built even though the netherlands remained neutral in this war amsterdam suffered a food shortage and heating fuel became scarce the shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed these riots are known as the aardappeloproer potato rebellion people started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies mainly food on january after a flood in the depleted municipalities of durgerdam holysloot zunderdorp and schellingwoude all lying north of amsterdam were at their own request annexed to the city between the wars the city continued to expand most notably to the west of the jordaan district in the frederik hendrikbuurt and surrounding neighbourhoods nazi germany invaded the netherlands on may and took control of the country some amsterdam citizens sheltered jews thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps more than dutch jews were deported to nazi concentration camps of whom some lived in amsterdam in response the dutch communist party organised the february strike attended by people to protest against the raids perhaps the most famous deportee was the young jewish girl anne frank who died in the bergen belsen concentration camp at the end of the second world war communication with the rest of the country broke down and food and fuel became scarce many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage dogs cats raw sugar beets and tulip bulbs cooked to a pulp were consumed to stay alive most of the trees in amsterdam were cut down for fuel and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported jews many new suburbs such as osdorp slotervaart slotermeer and geuzenveld were built in the years after the second world war these suburbs contained many public parks and wide open spaces and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms gardens and balconies because of the war and other events of the 20th century almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair as society was changing politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it there was an increasing demand for office buildings and also for new roads as the automobile became available to most people a metro started operating in between the new suburb of bijlmer and the centre of amsterdam further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect amsterdam centraal and city centre with other parts of the city the required large scale demolitions began in amsterdam s former jewish neighbourhood smaller streets such as the jodenbreestraat were widened and almost all of their houses were demolished at the peak of the demolition the nieuwmarktrellen nieuwmarkt riots broke out the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city as a result the demolition was stopped and the highway was never built only the metro was completed only a few streets remained widened the new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished waterlooplein meanwhile large private organisations such as stadsherstel amsterdam were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre although the success of this struggle is visible today efforts for further restoration are still ongoing the entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and as a whole is now a protected area many of its buildings have become monuments and in july the grachtengordel the three concentric canals herengracht keizersgracht and prinsengracht was added to the unesco world heritage list in the early years of the 21st century the amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists between and the annual number of visitors rose from million to million real estate prices have surged and local shops are making way for tourist oriented ones making the centre unaffordable for the city s inhabitants these developments have evoked comparisons with venice a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the river or lake ij to the centre was started in the project is controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor three by because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times since renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal especially in areas directly bordering the city centre such as frederik hendrikbuurt this urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city with the construction on artificial islands of the new eastern ijburg neighbourhood is part of the structural vision amsterdam initiative amsterdam is located in the western netherlands in the province of north holland although it is not its capital which is haarlem the river amstel ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the ij amsterdam is about below sea level the surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large polders a man made forest amsterdamse bos is in the southwest amsterdam is connected to the north sea through the long north sea canal amsterdam is intensely urbanised as is the amsterdam metropolitan area surrounding the city comprising of land the city proper has inhabitants per km and houses per km parks and nature reserves make up of amsterdam s land area amsterdam has more than of canals most of which are navigable by boat the city s three main canals are the prinsengracht herengracht and keizersgracht in the middle ages amsterdam was surrounded by a moat called the singel which now forms the innermost ring in the city and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape the city is also served by a seaport it has been compared with venice due to its division into about islands which are linked by more than bridges amsterdam has an oceanic climate k√∂ppen climate classification cfb strongly influenced by its proximity to the north sea to the west with prevailing westerly winds both winters and summers are considered mild although winters can get quite cold while summers are quite warm occasionally amsterdam as well as most of the north holland province lies in usda hardiness zone 8b frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner european continent even then because amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water as well as having a significant heat island effect nights rarely fall below while it could easily be in hilversum southeast summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month the average daily high in august is and or higher is only measured on average on days placing amsterdam in ahs heat zone the record extremes range from to days with more than of precipitation are common on average days per year amsterdam s average annual precipitation is more than what is measured at amsterdam schiphol airport a large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of october through march compared to other important towns in the county of holland such as dordrecht leiden haarlem delft and alkmaar amsterdam is a relatively young city in stark contrast to the relative decline of those other towns amsterdam s population grew in the 15th and 16th centuries mainly due to the rise of the profitable baltic maritime trade after the burgundian victory in the dutch hanseatic war still the population of amsterdam and other towns in holland was only modest compared to the towns and cities of flanders and brabant which comprised the most urbanised area of the low countries this changed when during the dutch revolt many people from the southern netherlands fled to the north especially after antwerp fell to spanish forces in in thirty years amsterdam s population more than doubled from inhabitants in to inhabitants in during the 1660s amsterdam s population reached the city s growth levelled off and the population stabilised around for most of the 18th century at the turn of the 18th century amsterdam was the fourth largest city in europe behind constantinople about london and paris this was all the more remarkable as amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the dutch republic which itself was a much smaller state than england france or the ottoman empire in contrast to those other metropolises amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as leiden about rotterdam haarlem and utrecht the city s population declined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries dipping under in by the second half of the 19th century industrialisation spurred renewed growth amsterdam s population hit an all time high of in before declining in the following decades due to government sponsored suburbanisation to so called groeikernen growth centres such as purmerend and almere between and amsterdam experienced its sharpest population decline ever and by the city had only residents this was soon followed by reurbanisation and gentrification however leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s in the 16th and 17th century non dutch immigrants to amsterdam were mostly huguenots flemings sephardi jews and westphalians huguenots came after the edict of fontainebleau in while the flemish protestants came during the eighty years war the westphalians came to amsterdam mostly for economic reasons their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries before the second world war of the city population was jewish just twenty per cent of them survived the shoah the first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from indonesia who came to amsterdam after the independence of the dutch east indies in the 1940s and 1950s in the 1960s guest workers from turkey morocco italy and spain emigrated to amsterdam after the independence of suriname in a large wave of surinamese settled in amsterdam mostly in the bijlmer area other immigrants including refugees asylum seekers and illegal immigrants came from europe america asia and africa in the 1970s and 1980s many old amsterdammers moved to new cities like almere and purmerend prompted by the third planological bill of the dutch government this bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so called groeikernen literally cores of growth young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de pijp and the jordaan abandoned by these amsterdammers the non western immigrants settled mostly in the social housing projects in amsterdam west and the bijlmer today people of non western origin make up approximately one third of the population of amsterdam and more than of the city s children ethnic dutch as defined by the dutch census now make up a minority of the total population although by far the largest one only one in three inhabitants under is an autochtoon or a person who has two parents of dutch origin segregation along ethnic lines is clearly visible with people of non western origin considered a separate group by statistics netherlands concentrating in specific neighbourhoods especially in nieuw west zeeburg bijlmer and in certain areas of amsterdam noord in christians formed the largest religious group in the city of the population the next largest religion was islam most of whose followers were sunni in the previously roman catholic city of amsterdam joined the revolt against spanish rule late in comparison to other major northern dutch cities following the dutch takeover all churches were converted to protestant worship calvinism became the dominant religion and although catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve the catholic hierarchy was prohibited this led to the establishment of schuilkerken covert churches behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts one example is the current debate centre de rode hoed a large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th century amsterdam in particular sefardic jews from spain and portugal huguenots from france and protestants from the southern netherlands this led to the establishment of many non dutch speaking religious churches in the first notification was made of jewish religious service in the first synagogue was consecrated the jews came to call the town jerusalem of the west a reference to their sense of belonging there as they became established in the city other christian denominations used converted catholic chapels to conduct their own services the oldest english language church congregation in the world outside the united kingdom is found at the begijnhof regular services there are still offered in english under the auspices of the church of scotland the huguenots accounted for nearly of amsterdam s inhabitants in being calvinists they soon integrated into the dutch reformed church though often retaining their own congregations some commonly referred by the moniker walloon are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in french in the second half of the 17th century amsterdam experienced an influx of ashkenazim jews from central and eastern europe which continued into the 19th century jews often fled the pogroms in those areas the first ashkenazi who arrived in amsterdam were refugees from the chmielnicki uprising in poland and the thirty years war they not only founded their own synagogues but had a strong influence on the amsterdam dialect adding a large yiddish local vocabulary despite an absence of an official jewish ghetto most jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city the main street of this jewish neighbourhood was the jodenbreestraat the neighbourhood comprised the waterlooplein and the nieuwmarkt buildings in this neighbourhood fell into disrepair after the second world war and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway this led to riots and as a result the original plans for large scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout catholic churches in amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in one of the principal architects behind the city s catholic churches cuypers was also responsible for the amsterdam central station and the rijksmuseum which led to a refusal of protestant king william iii to open that monastery in the roman catholic church of the netherlands hosted the international eucharistic congress in amsterdam and numerous catholic prelates visited the city where festivities were held in churches and stadiums catholic processions on the public streets however were still forbidden under law at the time only in the 20th century was amsterdam s relation to catholicism normalised but despite its far larger population size the catholic clergy chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of haarlem in recent times religious demographics in amsterdam have been changed by immigration from former colonies hinduism has been introduced from the hindu diaspora from suriname and several distinct branches of islam have been brought from various parts of the world islam is now the largest non christian religion in amsterdam the large community of ghanaian and nigerian immigrants have established african churches often in parking garages in the bijlmer area where many have settled in addition a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations including hinduism and buddhism jews make up about of the city s total population amsterdam experienced an influx of religions and cultures after the second world war with different nationalities amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world the proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about and of the population are dutch citizens amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free dutch language courses which have benefited many immigrants amsterdam fans out south from the amsterdam centraal railway station and damrak the main street off the station the oldest area of the town is known as de wallen english the quays it lies to the east of damrak and contains the city s famous red light district to the south of de wallen is the old jewish quarter of waterlooplein the medieval and colonial age canals of amsterdam known as grachten embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables beyond the grachtengordel are the former working class areas of jordaan and de pijp the museumplein with the city s major museums the vondelpark a 19th century park named after the dutch writer joost van den vondel and the plantage neighbourhood with the zoo are also located outside the grachtengordel several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are polders this can be recognised by the suffix meer which means lake as in aalsmeer bijlmermeer haarlemmermeer and watergraafsmeer the amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious city planning in the early 17th century when immigration was at a peak a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half circles of canals with their ends emerging at the ij bay known as the grachtengordel three of the canals were mostly for residential development the herengracht where heren refers to heren regeerders van de stad amsterdam ruling lords of amsterdam and gracht means canal so the name can be roughly translated as canal of the lords keizersgracht emperor s canal and prinsengracht prince s canal the fourth and outermost canal is the singelgracht which is often not mentioned on maps because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring the singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal singel the canals served for defence water management and transport the defences took the form of a moat and earthen dikes with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry superstructures the original plans have been lost so historians such as ed taverne need to speculate on the original intentions it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental construction started in and proceeded from west to east across the breadth of the layout like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian geert mak calls it and not from the centre outwards as a popular myth has it the canal construction in the southern sector was completed by subsequently the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly the eastern part of the concentric canal plan covering the area between the amstel river and the ij bay has never been implemented in the following centuries the land was used for parks senior citizens homes theatres other public facilities and waterways without much planning over the years several canals have been filled in becoming streets or squares such as the nieuwezijds voorburgwal and the spui after the development of amsterdam s canals in the 17th century the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries during the 19th century samuel sarphati devised a plan based on the grandeur of paris and london at that time the plan envisaged the construction of new houses public buildings and streets just outside the grachtengordel the main aim of the plan however was to improve public health although the plan did not expand the city it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date like the paleis voor volksvlijt following sarphati civil engineers jacobus van niftrik and jan kalff designed an entire ring of 19th century neighbourhoods surrounding the city s centre with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th century limit thus firmly controlling development most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class in response to overcrowding two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything amsterdam had ever seen before plan zuid designed by the architect berlage and west these plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes after the second world war large new neighbourhoods were built in the western southeastern and northern parts of the city these new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city s shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences the neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces connected to wide roads making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by motor car the western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the westelijke tuinsteden the area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the bijlmer amsterdam has a rich architectural history the oldest building in amsterdam is the oude kerk english old church at the heart of the wallen consecrated in the oldest wooden building is het houten huys at the begijnhof it was constructed around and is one of only two existing wooden buildings it is also one of the few examples of gothic architecture in amsterdam the oldest stone building of the netherlands the moriaan is build in s hertogenbosch in the 16th century wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones during this period many buildings were constructed in the architectural style of the renaissance buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable fa√ßades which is the common dutch renaissance style amsterdam quickly developed its own renaissance architecture these buildings were built according to the principles of the architect hendrick de keyser one of the most striking buildings designed by hendrick de keyer is the westerkerk in the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular as it was elsewhere in europe this roughly coincided with amsterdam s golden age the leading architects of this style in amsterdam were jacob van campen philips vingboons and daniel stalpaert philip vingboons designed splendid merchants houses throughout the city a famous building in baroque style in amsterdam is the royal palace on dam square throughout the 18th century amsterdam was heavily influenced by french culture this is reflected in the architecture of that period around architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo styles most gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a neo gothic style at the end of the 19th century the jugendstil or art nouveau style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style since amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style the houses in the vicinity of the museum square in amsterdam oud zuid are an example of jugendstil the last style that was popular in amsterdam before the modern era was art deco amsterdam had its own version of the style which was called the amsterdamse school whole districts were built this style such as the rivierenbuurt a notable feature of the fa√ßades of buildings designed in amsterdamse school is that they are highly decorated and ornate with oddly shaped windows and doors the old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century jugendstil and georgian are mostly found outside the city s centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses such as the famous merchants houses lining the canals amsterdam has many parks open spaces and squares throughout the city
